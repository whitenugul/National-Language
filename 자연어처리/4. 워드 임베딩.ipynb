Both the \"External Tank\" and\\n\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\\noptions list. Today\\'s (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\\nthat O\\'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\\nbeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\\nin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\\n\\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\\ntoday\\'s Times).\\n\\nOption \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach\\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\\noption are:\\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that\\'s\\n     qualified for STS and ELV\\'s. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\\n     for the Air Force.\\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\\n     source for 30 day missions.\\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\\n     Partners\\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\\n     add another 20 kW of power\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\\n     Vehicle).\\n\\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\\nhave all come to know and love :)\\n\\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \\nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\\n\\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\\n     it visits.\\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\\n     assembly in 24 flights.\\n\\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \\nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\\nchanges.',\n","  \"Hi!\\n\\n\\nSorry, it's german, but I hope you understand it.\\n\\n\\nUebertragung der Schaltplan-Daten (*.SCH) in die Board-Daten\\n(*.JOB):\\n\\nPADS-LOGIC:\\n         In/Out\\n         Reports\\n         Net List\\n         Select      PADS-PCB\\nNet List Output file name\\n         -> filename angeben\\n\\nPADS-PCB:\\n         In/Out\\n         Ascii In\\nAscii input file name\\n         -> filename angeben\\nErrors aoutput file name\\n         -> filename angeben, nicht CR\\n\\nJetzt sind alle Bauteile auf einem Haufen und muessen mit Move\\nverteilt werden.\\n\\nViele Gruesse\",\n","  'How can I obtain public information (documentation and sources)\\nabout Xservers implemented with graphics processors?\\n\\nI am specially interested in Xservers developed for the TMS34020\\nTexas Instruments graphic processor.',\n","  'The title says it all.

He might also have\\nsome money available...\\n\\nJohn Spencer, 1993/04/21\\n\\nIapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn's rings and Saturn\\nitself on 1993/05/01-02 (18:27-13:43 UT) and again on 1993/07/20-21,\\n(21:16-09:38 UT).  Timing is as follows;\\n\\n     1993 May 1-2\\n\\n        A-ring ingress  18:27\\n               egress   19:30\\n        B-ring ingress  19:51\\n               egress   21:42\\n        C-ring egress   23:00\\n        Saturn ingress  23:59\\n               egress   10:02\\n        B-ring ingress  10:28\\n               egress   12:19\\n        A-ring ingress  12:40\\n               egress   13:43\\n\\n     1993 July 20-21\\n\\n        Saturn ingress  21:16\\n               egress   05:08\\n        A-ring ingress  05:13  (grazing)\\n               egress   09:38\\n\\nTimes could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris,\\nand photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus'\\norbit.  Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from\\nIapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about\\nthe rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomy\\nand Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odell\\nof Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my\\nattention.\\n\\nTHERMAL OBSERVATIONS?\\n\\n\\n  To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July\\n  disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,\\n  etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,\\n  except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3\\n  airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with\\n  a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something\\n  to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.\\n\\n  Jay\\n\\nand again:\\n\\n  please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet\\n  disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would\\n  be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and\\n  getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a\\n  good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't\\n  think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are\\n  well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One\\n  possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.\\n\\njay\",\n","  '\\nYou certainly do not see OTC preparations advertised as such.\\nThe only such ridiculous concoctions are nostrums for premenstrual\\nsyndrome, ostensibly to treat headache and \"bloating\" simultaneously.\\nThey\\'re worthless.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s not the idea, and no, they don\\'t work.\\n',\n","  \"\\nLook at the 4053.

The Roman Empire\\nlasted until 1453, with its transfered capital in Constantinople.  The\\nmain reason for it\\'s fall was not so much the sack of Constantinople by\\nthe men of the 4th Crusade (who were not Christians - they had been\\nexcommunicated down to the last man after attacking the Christian city\\nof Zara in Croatia), but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle of\\nMazinkert.  After the Turks breached the frontier, it was only a matter\\nof time before the Empire fell, the inability of the Empire to hold onto\\nthe rim of Anatolia, with the Ottomans and Rum Seljuks in the middle\\nshould be quite obvious to any student of history.  The sack of\\nConstantinople only hastened the inevitable along.  For if the Greeks\\nhad wanted to save their empire, why would they not cooperate with the\\nCrusaders when they came to do battle with the Saracens in the 1st-3rd\\nCrusades?

Generally, even if accidently inoculated, the normal\\nimmune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant \\ninvolved with acupuncture needle insertion. \\n\\nMost acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They      \\ndo this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of \\ndiseases via this route...so it\\'s good business to advertise \"disposable needlesused here.\" These needles tend to be of a lower quality however, \\nbeing poorly manufactured and too \"sharp\" in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                        \\nIf I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will get \\ntheir own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.      \\nThe risk here for hepatitis, HIV, etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly \\nuse an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong              \\npatient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates \\nthis risk.

In China, herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into \\nmeridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require \\nthe same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will be \\ninjected into the body as it would  be in a typical \"shot.\" when the skin is \\npuntured. On the other hand when the solid \\nacupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to \"squeeze\" the needle \\nfrom the tip to the level of insertion such that any \\'cooties\\' that \\nhaven\\'t been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remain \\non the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior. \\n\\nOf course in TCM...the body\\'s exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory \\nand immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture \\nsite.\\n\\n\\nWhile I\\'m fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease \\ntransmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know for \\nwhat complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful.

There are however some which come very close to serving that\\npurpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way\\nprior to the invasion. \\n\\n   SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\\n   the Lebanese resistance.

Then replace \"prince\" with\\n\"government\" or \"president\", as appropriate, and read it again.  \\n\\n[From Chapter XX of _The Prince_, by N. Macchiavelli, as translated by\\nDaniel Donno.]\\n\\n\\tIn order to keep their lands secure, some princes have\\ndisarmed their subjects; others have prompted division within the\\ncities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities against\\nthemselves; others have sought to win the approval of those they\\ninitially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses; others have\\ndestroyed them.  Now, although it is impossible to set down definite\\njudgements on all of these measures without considering the particular\\ncircumstances of the states where they may be employed, I shall\\nnevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself\\nwill allow.\\n\\n\\tTo begin with, there has never been a case of a new prince\\ndisarming his subjects.  Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, he\\nproceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects, you make their\\narms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal,\\nwhile those who are already loyal remain so, and from subjects they\\nare transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all,\\nnonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by\\nextending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment of\\nthe two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, while\\nthe former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties\\nand dangers should receive advantages.  \\n\\n\\tWhen you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them, by\\nshowing that, either from cowardliness or from lack of faith, you\\ndistrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you.\\nMoreover, since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you would\\nhave to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already been\\ndiscussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never be\\ngood enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtful\\nsubjects.  Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquired\\nstate has always taken measures to arm his subjects, and history is\\nfull of examples proving that this is so.\\n\\n\\tBut when a prince takes posession of a new state which he\\nannexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm all\\nthe subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire\\nit; and these, as time and occasion permit, he must seek to render\\nsoft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of\\nthe entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to\\nhis original domain.\\n\\n\\t...',\n","  '\\n\\n This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism, i.e. the \\n belief that you can\\'t deny anything that you can\\'t prove doesn\\'t exist.\\n This is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are\\n conceivable but not observed to exist, does this mean that we would have\\n to believe in all of them?  According to the above poster, we must believe\\n in objects or beings that haven\\'t been proved not to exist so why stop at\\n God?   (there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan\\n except for trivial differences, say one is missing a finger, one has blond\\n hair,... and they all live  on other planets so we can\\'t see them)  The \\n reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians\\n have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God.\\n\\n\\n How did they shoot themselves in the foot?\\n\\n\\n  There is a big difference here, Stalin didn\\'t say that he stood for a \\n  particular moral position (i.e. against murder and terrorism, etc.) and\\n  then did the opposite (like the religious movements), he was at least\\n  an honest killer.  (This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this\\n  viewpoint).  Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because\\n  one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic, look at all the\\n  russians that helped Stalin that weren\\'t atheists - don\\'t they contradict\\n  your point?  Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant\\n  to his murdering people, this is just the common assumption that atheists\\n  can\\'t value life as much as theists (which you didn\\'t support).  \\n\\n\\n Ah, and here\\'s another point you didn\\'t get out of the FAQ.  An atheist\\n doesn\\'t have to hold the positive view that god doesn\\'t exist, he/she may\\n just have the non-existence of the positive belief.  Here\\'s the example:\\n \\n Strong atheism - \"I believe god does not exist\"   a positive belief\\n\\n Weak atheism   - \"I don\\'t believe in a god\"       a negative belief\\n \\n these are NOT the same, some one that has never thought of the idea of\\n god in their whole life is technically an atheist, but not the kind that\\n you are calling unreasonable.  Or let\\'s look at it this way (in sets)\\n \\n suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent\\n as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas\\n exist as real objects or not.  So if S = santa, then E(S)= no is the person\\n not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa.  But notice that\\n even E(S) = no  is itself another idea!

She was saying something to me, but I couldn\\'t \\nunderstand it. Then I made out, \"It hurts, I hurt all over.\" Her hair was \\nglued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her \\nforehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don\\'t know how \\nto help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She\\'s\\nsaying something to me, but I can\\'t understand her. Igor brings her a pencil \\nand paper and says, \"Write it down.\" She shakes her head as if to say, no, I \\ncan\\'t write. I can\\'t understand what she\\'s saying. She wanted to tell me \\nsomething, but she couldn\\'t. I say, \"Karina, just lie there a little while,\\nthen maybe you\\'ll feel better and you can tell me then.\" And then she says,\\n\"Maybe it\\'ll be too late.\" And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn\\'t\\ncontrol myself.\\n\\nThen I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dipped\\na handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She \\nsays, \"Lyuda, we\\'re not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this \\ndamned house. They want to kill us, I know. They\\'ll find us here, too. We need\\nto call Urshan.\" She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I \\nunderstood her every word. I ask, \"What\\'s his number?\" Urshan Feyruzovich, \\nthat\\'s the head of the administration where she works. \"We have to call him.\" \\nBut I didn\\'t know his home number. I say, \"Karina, what\\'s his number?\" She \\nsays, \"I can\\'t remember.\" I say, \"Who knows his number? Who can I call?\" She \\nsays, \"I don\\'t know anything, leave me alone.\"\\n\\nI went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was \\ncrying, too. I say, \"Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can \\nwe call him? Who knows his telephone number?\" I tell Marina, \"Think, think, \\nwho can we call to find out?\" She started calling; several people didn\\'t \\nanswer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and \\nfound out the number and called us back. The boss\\'s wife answered and said he \\nwas at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can\\'t talk normally. She says, \\n\"Lyuda, don\\'t panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and \\ntell them that they just can\\'t do that.\" She still didn\\'t know what was really\\ngoing on. I said, \"It\\'s easy for you to say that, you don\\'t understand what\\'s \\nhappening. They are killing people here. I don\\'t think there is a single \\nArmenian left in the building, they\\'ve cut them all up. I\\'m even surprised \\nthat we managed to save ourselves. \"She says, \"Well, OK, if it\\'s that serious \\n. . . \" And all the same she\\'s thinking that my emotions are all churned up \\nand that I\\'m fearing for my life, that in fact it\\'s not all that bad. \"OK, \\nfine, fine,\" she says, \"if you\\'re afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back \\nI\\'ll send him over.\"\\n\\nWe called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly \\nunder Aunt Tanya\\'s, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian\\'s apartment. She \\nwasn\\'t home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed \\neverything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept on\\ntrying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan\\'s wife is named Tanya too and \\nfinally we get through. She says, \"Yes, he\\'s come home, he\\'s leaving for your \\nplace now.\" He came. Of course he didn\\'t know what was happening, either, \\nbecause he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep \\nwith his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what \\nshape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has \\ngrown up daughters, they\\'re almost my age.\\n\\nThe three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and\\nwent down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No, \\nfirst they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As\\nsoon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said\\nthat we were in serious condition and that we mustn\\'t move, we might have\\nfractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the\\nfirst floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around\\neleven o\\'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I \\nsaw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies\\n. . . everything just like a war.\\n\\nThey carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical\\npeople from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older \\nArmenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she\\'s so proud \\nshe would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle \\nArkady, I think, because someone said \"Arkady, get an injection ready,\" he \\nstarted to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But \\nwhen he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his \\nsixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and \\nstarted to cry: \"What have they done to you?!\" He was speaking Armenian. \"What\\nhave they done to you?!\" Karina didn\\'t say anything. Mamma came in then, and \\nshe started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. \"I\\'ll give you a shot.\" \\nMamma tells him, \"I don\\'t need any shot. Where is the government? Just what \\nare they doing? Look what they\\'ve done to my children! They\\'re killing people,\\nand you\\'re just sitting here!\" Some teacups were standing on the table in \\nthere. \"You\\'re sitting here drinking tea! Look what they\\'ve done to my \\ndaughters! Look what they\\'ve turned them into!\" They gave her something to \\ndrink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the\\ndoctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa \\nand Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina \\nout. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I \\ndon\\'t know, maybe there weren\\'t any orderlies. Then they came to me: \"What\\'s \\nthe matter with you?\" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter\\nin the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya\\'s.\\nI said, \"I\\'m fine.\" Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told \\nthe doctor, \"You leave, let a woman examine her.\" A woman came, an \\nAzerbaijani, I believe, and said, \"What\\'s wrong with you?\" I was wearing my \\nsister Lyuda\\'s nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When \\nshe was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would \\nbe easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed\\nher. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge \\nwound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said \\nsomething to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be \\ndressed with something, but that they\\'d do that in the hospital.\\n\\nThey put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me. \\nI raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don\\'t \\nknow if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, \"Lie still, you mustn\\'t move.\" When\\nI was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed \\nvery familiar to me. I shouted, \"Stop!\" One of the policemen turned and says, \\n\"What do you want?\" I say, \"Bring him to me, I want to look at him.\" They \\nbrought him over and I said, \"That person was just in our apartment and he \\njust raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down.\" They said, \\n\"Fine,\" but didn\\'t write it down and led him on. I don\\'t know where they were \\ntaking him.\\n\\nThen they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were \\nsitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car \\nup closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, \"Sister . . . \" I don\\'t \\nremember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they\\ndid to us. I asked him, \"Where are you from?\" He said that he was from Ufa. \\nApparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I \\nlearned that they suffered most of all. He says, \"OK, you\\'re Armenians, they \\ndidn\\'t get along with you, but I\\'m a Russian,\" he says, \"what are they trying \\nto kill me for?\" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the \\nbalcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw \\ntwo Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed \\nagainst the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him\\nwith his own club. The way he cried \"Mamma\" made my skin crawl. I don\\'t know \\nwhat they did to him, if he\\'s still alive or not. And something else. Before \\nhe attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the\\nthird or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn\\'t think it was \\nAzerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they\\nwere throwing something they didn\\'t need out, or someone was fighting with \\nsomeone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the \\nyard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that\\nI realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.\\n\\nThey took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too \\nand said, \"I\\'ve been beaten too, help me.\" But they just ignored her. My \\nfather went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault \\nthat he\\'d been beaten, and says, \"My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have \\nprobably broken my ribs. Please look at them.\" The doctor says, \"That\\'s not my\\njob.\" Urshan said, \"Fine, I\\'ll take you to my place and if we need a doctor, \\nI\\'ll find you one. I\\'ll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them \\nto his apartment.\\n\\nMarina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the \\ndoctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I \\nwasn\\'t surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very\\nsurprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the\\nHippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy--\\ncoincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she,\\nhaving examined Karina, said, \"No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like \\nthey did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women.\\n\"Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn\\'t say anything--she\\nwould certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same \\nstory. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no \\ndrugs. Absolutely none! They didn\\'t even give us tea. All the women there soon\\nfound out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And\\nthey started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at \\nzoo animals. Karina didn\\'t see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from \\nseeing it.\\n\\nThey put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn\\'t have \\nany serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their \\nplace, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira \\nher daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And\\nIra was holding her daughter\\'s hand, the one who was hiding under the bed.\\nWhen they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she \\ninvoluntarily let go of her daughter\\'s hand, her daughter took her hand again.\\nHer daughter is in the fourth grade, she\\'s 11 years old. I felt really awful \\nwhen I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, \"Do what\\nyou want with me, just leave my daughter alone.\" Well, they did what they \\nwanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I \\nwould be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It \\nwas simply Bartholomew\\'s Night, I say, they did what they would love to do \\nevery day: steal, kill, rape . . .\\n\\nMany are surprised that those animals didn\\'t harm the children. The beasts \\nexplained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those \\nchildren would be grown, and then, as they put it, \"we\\'ll come take the \\npleasure out of their lives, those children.\" This was about the girls that\\nwould be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow \\nbecause they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just\\nas there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be \\nof some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the \\nvictims testified to it. That\\'s how they described their own natures, that\\nthey would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they\\nthemselves said that.\\n\\nAnd this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn\\'t harm our Marina. Many \\npeople say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don\\'t know \\nwhy their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn\\'t slept the night before, \\nmaybe for some other reason, I don\\'t know. But they hadn\\'t been smoking and \\nthey weren\\'t drunk, I\\'m positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at \\nnothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with \\nMarina: \"Little sister, don\\'t be afraid, we won\\'t harm you, don\\'t look over \\nthere [where I was], you might be frightened. You\\'re a Muslim, a Muslim woman \\nshouldn\\'t see such things.\" So they were really quite sober . . .\\n\\nSo we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all \\nhappened bears the mark of that day. It wasn\\'t even a day, of those several \\nhours. Father still can\\'t look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what\\nhappened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he\\'s started talk-\\ning to himself, I\\'ve heard him argue with himself several times when he\\nthought no one is listening: \"Listen,\" he\\'ll say, \"what could I do? What could\\nI do alone, how could I protect them?\" I don\\'t know where to find the words,\\nit\\'s not that I\\'m happy, but I am glad that he didn\\'t see it all happen. \\nThat\\'s the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of \\ncourse he knows it all, but there\\'s no way you could imagine every last detail\\nof what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke\\ntogether in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never\\npresent at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And\\nwhen the investigator comes to the house, we don\\'t speak with Father present.\\n\\nOn February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital.\\nFirst they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city, \\nthe soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier. \\nThere were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family \\nthere. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They \\nwere sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik\\'s wife \\nand Grant\\'s daughter, and her mother, were both crying.\\n\\nThen they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard.\\nThere\\'s a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area.\\nThey took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought\\nthat they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become\\nso dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide.\\nThe women were shouting. They explained to them: \"We want to hide you\\nbetter because it\\'s possible there will be an attack on the police precinct.\"\\n\\nWe went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We\\nhad children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to \\nhave their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful. \\nThey kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you \\ncould see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the \\npolice precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is \\nsurrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it\\'s electrified, but if they were \\nstanding on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought \\ngreat psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn\\'t \\njust walked out of their apartments, but who hadn\\'t slept for 24 hours, or 48,\\nor those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost \\nfamily members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened \\nwhen all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn\\'t see a single\\nperson, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must\\nhave already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret \\nroom down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at\\none another . . . That\\'s the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those \\npeople, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that\\nthe end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the \\nhospital and didn\\'t know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my \\nparents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should \\nattack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an \\nArmenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and \\nshe wouldn\\'t be able to take it.\\n\\nThen soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people \\nclimbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers.\\nThey all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We \\ncalmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some \\nlittle cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children\\nto the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never \\nhave occurred to any of us that we hadn\\'t eaten for two days and that people \\ndo eat.\\n\\nThen, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They \\nwere being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from \\nthe courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a \\ndifferent woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing, \\nand calling out: \"Oh, Rafik!,\" but when she heard about this such a rage came \\nover her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her \\nsleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were \\nsoldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were\\nstanding there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up\\nto one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash \\nhim! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not \\none of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from \\ndoing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands, \\nmuttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile\\nappeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round\\nwas over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing \\nterribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the \\ncreeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did \\nthis the whole night through, well, it wasn\\'t really night, no one slept. She \\nwent five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women, \\n\"What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they \\nraped, and you\\'re just sitting there. You\\'re sitting and talking as though \\nnothing had happened. Aren\\'t you Armenians?\" She appealed to everyone, but no \\none got up. I was just numb, I didn\\'t have the strength to beat anyone, I \\ncould barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so \\nmany hours--I was released at eleven o\\'clock in the morning and it was already\\nafter ten at night because there weren\\'t enough chairs, really it was the \\nelderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time. \\nThere was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking. \\nThe situation was deplorable.\\n\\nAt eleven o\\'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen, \\nAzerbaijanis. They said, \"Get up. They\\'ve brought mattresses, you can wash up\\nand put the children to bed.\" Now the women didn\\'t want to leave this place, \\neither. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with \\ndogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, \"Oh, it\\'s our little \\nfamily,\" and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for \\nthe first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone\\nspoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded\\nmachine guns in their hands, said, \"Grandmother, you mustn\\'t approach me,\\nI\\'m on guard.\" Our people would say, \"Oh, that\\'s all right.\" They hugged\\nthem, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly\\nmoving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.\\n\\nThey took us up to the second floor and said, \"You can undress and sleep in \\nhere. Don\\'t be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it\\'s quiet in the city.\"\\nThis was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other\\nplaces. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the\\nSK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I \\nasked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me.\\nI didn\\'t know what was happening there. They told me, \"Don\\'t worry, the\\nMaternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest\\nassured. I say, \"Well, I won\\'t rest assured regardless, because the staff in\\nthere is capable of anything.\"\\n\\nWhen I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had\\nalready been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi-\\ntal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once\\nwe were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met \\nacquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who \\nhadn\\'t been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with \\nthem, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had \\ncome their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like \\nthey had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people, \\nhungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of \\ncourse the stories and the talk were flying: \"Oh, I heard that they killed \\nhim!\" \"What do you mean they killed him!\" \"He stayed at work!\" \"Do you know \\nwhat\\'s happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.\\n\\nAnd then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very \\nwell and respect him highly. I\\'ve known him for a long time. They had a small \\nroom, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night \\ntalking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary \\nof the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see \\nBagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed \\nfrom outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask \\nhim things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by \\nsoldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn\\'t deign to speak with \\nthe people. Apparently he had more important things to do.\\n\\nSeveral hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, \"Lyudochka, find another \\ntwo or three. We\\'re going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs, \\nlists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people \\nwho had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned.\" I \\nhad about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, \"Lyuda, your \\nMamma has arrived, she\\'s looking for you, she doesn\\'t believe that you are \\nalive and well and that you\\'re here.\" I gave the lists to someone and asked \\nthem to continue what I was doing and went off.\\n\\nThe list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian\\'s\\nfather, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels\\nGrigorian\\'s father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the \\nname of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said \\nthat he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front\\nof the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later \\nit turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had\\nsomehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for \\nKrasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that \\nin addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored \\nmissing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3\\n\\nAll the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don\\'t remember how many dead were \\ncontained in the list, but it\\'s a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple \\nof minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, \"What\\'s \\ngoing on?\" He said, \"Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels\\nthey are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev\\n[Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party\\nof the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to\\nhim, so that he\\'d see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it\\nwas one or fifty.\" They told him that the list had disappeared and they\\nshould ask everyone who hadn\\'t left for the Khimik boarding house all over\\nagain. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26\\nwas the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because\\nthat\\'s the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26 \\npeople on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only \\na half of those that were on the first list. He said, \"Lyuda, please, try to\\nremember at least one more.\" But I couldn\\'t remember anyone else. But there\\nwere more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy\\ndon\\'t count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people \\nwhose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren\\'t registered as victims of\\nthe Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn\\'t know. So many \\npeople left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns\\nin Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the \\nKrasnodarsk Territory. We don\\'t have any information on them. I know that \\nthere are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical \\nKrestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk \\ncows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went \\nto help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering\\nthe city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the \\nAzerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there\\'s\\nmore. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list \\ndrawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course\\ndon\\'t know them all. I\\'m thinking of three women whose parents chose not to \\npublicize what had happened, that is, they didn\\'t take the matter to court, \\nthey simply left. But in so doing they didn\\'t cease being victims. One of them\\nis the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No. \\n8, on the fifth floor. I can\\'t tell you the building number and I don\\'t know \\nher name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in \\nMicrodistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don\\'t know her name, she lives on the \\nsame landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding \\nthe door while his daughter hid, but he couldn\\'t hold the door forever, and \\nwhen she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors\\' they seized her by her \\nbraid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because \\nthey didn\\'t kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one \\n. . . I don\\'t remember who the third one was anymore.\\n\\nThey transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn\\'t herself. Yes, we lived for\\ndays in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there \\nand I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn\\'t stay with Karina; \\nit was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could \\nalready walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the \\nsocial work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said, \\n\"If it weren\\'t for the work I would go insane.\" He and I put ourselves in gear\\nand took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers \\nand free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything, \\nalthough we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been \\ndispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it \\nwas free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by\\nto see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly\\nvisible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.\\n\\nOn March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir\\nFedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered \\nonly Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital.\\nMother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.\\n\\nShirokov was involved with Karina\\'s case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I \\ntold him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and\\nrecord everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind. \\nWe didn\\'t work with the identikit until the very last day because the\\nconditions weren\\'t there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor \\nquality work solely because the situation wasn\\'t conducive to working: there \\nweren\\'t enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a \\ncurfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or \\nvideo cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We\\'re not so poor that \\nwe can\\'t supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially \\nto draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw\\nthat the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to \\nSumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with \\nBibishev, I told him myself, \"Don\\'t you worry, if it takes us a month or two \\nmonths, I\\'ll be here. I\\'m not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in\\nthose two days, I\\'ll help you conduct the investigation.\"\\n\\nHe and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I\\ngave them so much to do that for a while they didn\\'t have the time to get to\\nher, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her-\\nself. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x-\\nrays. She couldn\\'t eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn\\'t eat\\nand drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we\\nwere in Baku already, the investigator told me, \"How long can you go on like \\nthis? Well fine, so you don\\'t want to eat, you don\\'t love yourself, you\\'re\\nnot taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this\\ninvestigation through. We need you.\" Then I started eating, because in fact I\\nwas exhausted. It wasn\\'t enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart-\\nment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement\\ncells and prisons. I don\\'t know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in\\nevery prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of\\nSumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary \\nconfinement.\\n\\nThus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma \\nidentified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn\\'t identify \\nanyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren\\'t among the \\nphotographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one \\nwho went after the axe. He still hasn\\'t been detained, he\\'s still on the \\nloose. He\\'s gone, and it\\'s not clear if he will be found or not. I don\\'t know \\nhis first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his \\nsisters\\' faces. But he\\'s not in the city. The investigators informed me that \\neven if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will \\ncontinue looking for him.\\n\\nThe 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various \\nplants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect.\\nMostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Only\\none of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and\\nChemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga-\\ntor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in front\\nof me \"I\\'ll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash\\nsimply for keeping him out of Armenia,\" that is, to keep him from landing in\\na prison on Armenian soil. They\\'re all terribly afraid of that, because if the\\ninvestigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn\\'t confess even\\nthough we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological\\npressure--they say, \"Fine, don\\'t confess, just keep silent. When you\\'re in an\\nArmenian prison, when they find out who you are, they\\'ll take care of you\\nin short order.\" That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.\\n\\nThe investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire\\npogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then\\nthat I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was \\nin our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and \\nall the valuables, but didn\\'t take a single book. They tore them up, burned \\nthem, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials\\nfrom the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James \\nFenimore Cooper\\'s Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were \\nboiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had \\nbeen in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That\\'s \\nenough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don\\'t\\neven know anything about books. They didn\\'t take a single book, but they did \\ntake worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out \\nslippers.\\n\\nOf those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait. \\nBasically, the group that went seeking \"revenge\"--let\\'s use their word for \\nit--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with \\none of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that \\nblack I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking\\npart in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of \\nTamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently\\narrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I \\ndon\\'t know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an \\nAzerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know \\nnothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an \\naxe. Murdering her wasn\\'t enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and \\nthrew them into the tub with water.\\n\\nI remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You \\nknow, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both \\ntheir hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey-\\neyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I \\nidentified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born\\nin the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How \\ndid I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I \\nkept thinking, is that Rita or \"puma,\" which it would be if you read the word \\nas Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic \"T\" was the one \\nthat looks like a Latin \"M.\" When they led him in he sat with his hands behind\\nhis back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to\\nput in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and \\ntold me that I was making a mistake, and called me \"dear sister.\" He said, \\n\"You\\'re wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an \\nArmenian,\" and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator \\nasked me, \"Lyuda, are you sure it was he?\" I told him, \"I\\'ll tell you one more\\nidentifying mark. If I\\'m wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The \\nname Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand.\" He went rigid and became \\npale. They told him, \"Put your hands on the table.\" He put his hands on the\\ntable with the palms up. I said, \"Now turn your hands over,\" but he didn\\'t \\nturn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start\\nacknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn\\'t wanted to do it, that they \\nforced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently.\\nBut he insolently stuck to his story, \"No, I did not do anything, it wasn\\'t \\nme.\" When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his\\nhand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew\\ninto a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out \\nof granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it. \\nCatching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked\\nand the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and \\nback. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don\\'t know how, \\nbut I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or \\nstrangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the \\nmicrophone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his\\nlast name, and he says, \"Lyudochka, it\\'s a Japanese microphone! Please . . .\\n\" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped. \\nThey took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down, \\nbecause we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, \"You\\'re \\nsome actress! What a performance!\" I said, \"Tolya, honestly . . . \" Beforehand\\nthey would always tell me, \"Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if \\nnothing had happened to you.\" I say, \"I don\\'t have any more strength or \\nemotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength \\n. . . I don\\'t have the strength to do anything.\" And he says, \"Lyuda, how were\\nyou able to do that?\" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching\\nthe tape, I said, \"Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped \\nthat high in gym class.\"\\n\\nSo you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of \\nthe 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who \\nbeat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.\\n\\nAt the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his \\nguilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among\\nthem were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said, \\n\"Tomorrow we\\'re going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three\\no\\'clock.\" He said, \"No, I\\'m not coming.\" They told him, \"If you don\\'t come \\nwe\\'ll kill you.\" He said, \"Alright, I\\'ll come.\" And he went.\\n\\nThey also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He\\nhad also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a \\nmotorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him \\nout of his apartment and told him the same thing: \"Tomorrow we\\'re going to get\\nthe Armenians. Be there.\" He said, \"No.\" They pulled a knife on him. He said, \\n\"I\\'m not going all the same.\" And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed \\nhim several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was\\nin the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that \\nwe would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.\\n\\nI\\'ll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he\\nbeat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he\\nwas very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for\\nhim, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning\\nof Shagen Sargisian. I don\\'t know if he participated in the rapes in our \\napartment; I didn\\'t see, I don\\'t remember. But the people who were in our \\napartment who didn\\'t yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I \\ndon\\'t know if he confessed or not, and I myself don\\'t recall because I blacked\\nout very often. But I think that he didn\\'t participate in the rape of Karina\\nbecause he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the\\ncourtyard, he remained in the apartment.\\n\\nAt one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her\\nI learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn\\'t \\nhave a father, and that he\\'s been convicted twice. Well this will be his third\\nand, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work\\nwith bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.\\n\\nThe others who were detained . . . well they\\'re little beasts. You really can\\'t\\ncall them beasts, they\\'re just little beasts. They were robots carrying out\\nsomeone else\\'s will, because at the investigation they all said, \"I don\\'t \\nunderstand how I could have done that, I was out of my head.\" But we know that\\nthey were won around to it and prepared for it, that\\'s why they did it. In the\\nname of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam--\\nthat\\'s holy to them--that\\'s why they did everything they were commanded to do.\\nBecause I saw they didn\\'t have minds of their own, I\\'m not talking about their\\nlevel of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they\\nwork, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they \\ncrowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were \\npromised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments.\\nSo off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, \"they \\npromised us apartments.\"\\n\\nAmong them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the\\nheart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a \\nchildren\\'s home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at \\nthe children\\'s home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they \\nhave they earned by their own labor, and wasn\\'t inherited from parents or \\ngrandparents. And he said, \"I didn\\'t need anything I just don\\'t know . . . how\\nI ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my \\nown, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing.\" And the whole time I\\nkept repeating, \"Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife \\nright before your own eyes.\" He sat there and just wailed.\\n\\nBut that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a \\nmarvelous disappearing act, but I think that they\\'ll get onto him, they just \\nhave to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his\\ngrandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how \\nto cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he \\nknew and those he didn\\'t, either, and other things as well, and changed \\nhimself like a chameleon so they wouldn\\'t get onto him, but he was detained.\\n\\nThat one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians\\' after Aleksandr \\nGambarian was murdered. He came in and said, \"Let\\'s go, enough, you\\'ve spilled\\nenough blood here.\"\\n\\nMaybe Karina doesn\\'t know this but the reason they didn\\'t finish her off was \\nthat they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya\\nand her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They \\nliked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When \\nKarina came to at one point--she doesn\\'t remember this yet, this the neighbors \\nold me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to \\nthe entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were \\nalready at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians\\'. They came back\\nand started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have \\nsustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older \\nwoman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of \\nKarina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off.\\nThe woman\\'s grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands \\nand led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth, \\nhe sees everything, and He won\\'t forgive this.\\n\\nThere was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first \\nfloor, she\\'s already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a\\ncustom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them.\\nBut they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is \\ntantamount to trampling a woman\\'s honor.\\n\\nNow that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we \\nhave gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these \\nevents that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come \\nabout? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it\\'s clear that \\nwithout a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not \\nhave happened. All the same, I\\'m not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis,\\nlet other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their \\nnations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are \\na people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for\\nwhat they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like\\nunleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn\\'t have time to do everything, they \\nthrew themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done,\\nto snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on\\nFebruary 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone \\nwho had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left\\nfor their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got\\nas far away as their legs would carry them.\\n\\nFebruary 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came \\ninto my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had \\nbeen a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for \\na meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few \\nteachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or \\nseven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there \\nwere a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the \\nevening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and \\nthe crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the \\nmicrophone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the \\ndriver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani\\nchild off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had\\nseen it himself..The crowd started to rage: \"Death to the Armenians! They must\\nbe killed!\" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn\\'t see the woman because \\npeople were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The \\nwoman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians \\ncut her daughters\\' breasts off, and called, \"Sons, avenge my daughters!\" That \\nwas enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the \\ndirection of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.\\n\\nWe stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a \\nvery nationalist speech. He said, \"Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!\" This \\nhe repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him \\nstormily, whistling and shouting \"Karabagh!\" He said, \"Karabagh has been our \\nterritory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my \\nheart?\" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. \"It\\'s our \\nterritory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated. \\nFrom time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from\\ntime immemorial, that\\'s the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years \\nthe Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth.\" By filth he meant \\nArmenians.\\n\\nI heard this. Before that I hadn\\'t been listening to the speeches closely.\\nMany people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with \\nthe other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn\\'t penetrate,\\nthat in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our\\nteachers said, \"Listen to what he\\'s saying, listen to what idiocy he\\'s \\nspouting,\" we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we \\nlistened to the woman\\'s speech.\\n\\nRight then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the \\nsubject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of\\nstudies, for whom I had great respect, he\\'s an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I\\nhad considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to \\nobtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me,\\n\"Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If \\nthey find out that you\\'re an Armenian they\\'ll tear you to pieces. Should I \\ntell them you\\'re an Armenian? Should I tell them you\\'re an Armenian?\" When he \\nsaid it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a \\nsecond time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already\\nafter eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered, \\n\"No, they said that women should stay here until ten o\\'clock,.and men, until \\ntwelve. Stay here.\" There was a young teacher with us, her children were in \\nkindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: \"I left my \\nchildren at the kindergarten.\" The director excused her. When she let her go I\\nturned around, said, \"Good-bye,\" and left with the young teacher, the \\nAzerbaijani. I didn\\'t see them after that.\\n\\nWhen we were walking the buses weren\\'t running, and a crowd from the rally ran\\nnearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too \\nmuch for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed \\noff. I wasn\\'t afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher \\nwouldn\\'t say that I was an Armenian.\\n\\nTo make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at \\nthe movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and\\nagain my parents didn\\'t understand that we were in danger. We watched \\ntelevision as usual, and didn\\'t even imagine that tomorrow would be our last \\nday. That\\'s how it all was.\\n\\nAt the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together,\\nZhanna, I don\\'t remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store \\non Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she \\ndoesn\\'t have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father \\nheld the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the \\nground was wet and that there wasn\\'t anyone behind the building when she went \\nout on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the \\nentryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders \\nthere. She jumped. She jumped and didn\\'t feel any pain in the heat of the \\nmoment. A few days later I found out that she couldn\\'t stand up, she had been \\ninjured somehow. That\\'s how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor, \\nand their children: any way they could. \\n\\nWhere it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father\\'s first cousin, \\nArmen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims \\nwhat was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one \\nanother immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even \\nwith muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and \\ntheir old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got \\nthem right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked \\nelectricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then \\nthey took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she\\'s an \\nAzerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director\\nand told her that if she didn\\'t help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to \\nescape alive and unharmed, she\\'d never see her daughter again. I\\'m sure, of \\ncourse, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only\\nthing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The \\nArmenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored \\npersonnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and\\nled everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored \\npersonnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that \\nvery moment, into Block 30. That\\'s how they defended themselves.\\n\\nI heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They\\'re big, \\nstrong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a \\nstrong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.\\n\\nOne of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking \\nfor the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected, \\npeople hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps \\ndead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went \\nwith the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found \\nAzerbaijani corpses. I don\\'t know how many. Even if they had been wounded and \\nput down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or \\ninfection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the \\nneighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject \\ncame up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the \\nbasement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor\\ncarried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing \\nas one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor \\ntook his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything \\nseemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing \\nof ours he had managed to \"save.\"\\n\\nRaya\\'s husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended \\nthemselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were\\nAzerbaijani victims, although we\\'ll never hear anything about them. For some \\nreason our government doesn\\'t want to say that the Armenians were not just \\nvictims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too. \\nIn the TV show \"Pozitsiya\" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that \\nthe Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that\\'s not \\nimportant, the truth will come out regardless.\\n\\nSo that\\'s the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our \\nbravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the \\nyears and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we\\'ve \\nbecome, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.\\n\\nOn that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said\\nthat it\\'s not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments\\nreceived by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans \\nwill depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the \\nProcuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga-\\ntion. That\\'s the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on \\nthe street at night, to not be afraid to say we\\'re Armenians, and to not fear\\nspeaking our native tongue.\\n\\n   October 15,1988\\n   Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t- - - reference for #008 - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Rather than use technology to accommodate\\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n\\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n\\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\ncommercial use today.\\n\\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n\\nA \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n\"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n\\n\\n                                2\\n\\n\\n\"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\nin two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\nwiretap.\\n\\nThe \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\\nconversations of Americans.\\n\\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\ntheir findings.\\n\\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\nencryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\\n\\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\\n\\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\\n\\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\\n          technology to build the National Information\\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\\n          marketplace; and \\n\\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\\n          high technology products.\\n\\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                3\\n\\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\\n(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today\\'s telephone\\nsystem transmits voice.\\n\\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\nprotect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\nthem from those who break the law.\\n\\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \\nThe provisions of the President\\'s directive to acquire the new\\nencryption technology are also available.  \\n\\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\\n\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n\\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION\\'S\\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\\n\\nA:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\\n     conversations of Americans.\\n\\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n     decipher the message?\\n\\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\\n     escrow system.\\n\\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\\n\\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n\\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\\n     how strong the security is?  \\n\\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\\n     vulnerabilities.\\n\\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\\n\\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n     officials.\\n\\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n\\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n     decisions related to this initiative.\\n\\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n\\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n     manufacturer that produces them.\\n\\nQ:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n\\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\\n     to other vendors in the future.\\n\\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \\n\\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\\n     the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\\n     \\nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n     powerful encryption devices?\\n\\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\\n     developing.\\n\\n     The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\\n     false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n     an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\\n     Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n\\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n     Administration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \\n\\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n     and terrorism.\\n\\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n     the government hardware?\\n\\nA:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\\n     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\\n     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\\n     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\\n     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\\n     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\\n     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\\n     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\\n     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\\n     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\\n     of these products.\\n\\n----------- End included article ----------- \\n',\n","  \"I heard that Eli is selling the team to a group in Cinninati.

The Cryptography \\nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \\nevery 21 days.\\n\\n\\nContents:\\n\\n* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?\\n* What are the US export regulations?\\n* What is TEMPEST?\\n* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?\\n* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?\\n* Is RSA patented?\\n* What about the Voynich manuscript?\\n\\n\\n* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?\\n\\n  The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It\\n  was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40's, and\\n  has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is\\n  known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,\\n  and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the\\n  world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of\\n  cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many\\n  years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break\\n  many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national\\n  security almost all information about the NSA is classified.\\n\\n  Bamford's book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of\\n  the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the\\n  difference between public and private research in cryptography:\\n\\n  ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,\\n  one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted\\n  behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged\\n  today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of\\n  those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10\\n  years has there in fact been widespread open research in\\n  cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts\\n  between these two research communities. Open research is common\\n  quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open\\n  exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in\\n  scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with\\n  responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,\\n  countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can\\n  a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might\\n  undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?\\n  One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would\\n  force all governments to behave like Stimson's `gentlemen', but one\\n  must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with\\n  political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most\\n  scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have\\n  occurred between government agencies and open researchers in\\n  cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which\\n  we are aware) have been so few and so mild.''\\n\\n* What are the US export regulations?\\n\\n  In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control\\n  export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export\\n  Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by\\n  the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office\\n  of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized\\n  by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule\\n  of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent\\n  requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see\\n  everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.\\n\\n  The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting\\n  discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what\\n  people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which\\n  go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to\\n  consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in\\n  jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at\\n  least heard of the ITAR.\\n\\n* What is TEMPEST?\\n\\n  TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer\\n  equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that\\n  information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at\\n  quite a distance and with little effort.\\n\\n  Needless to say, encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext\\n  is available this way.\\n\\n* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?\\n\\n  (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for\\n  corrections.)\\n\\n  The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas\\n  Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass\\n  of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving\\n  three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the\\n  location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.\\n  Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;\\n  it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the\\n  Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;\\n  many documents have been tried as the key to B1.\\n\\n  Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various\\n  means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:\\n\\n  The Beale Cypher Association\\n  P.O.

The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,\\n  says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)\\n\\n  Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of\\n  problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI\\n  and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.\\n  Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this\\n  string couldn't appear by chance, but feels there must be an\\n  explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this\\n  string.\\n\\n* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?\\n\\n  The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis\\n  on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with\\n  pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram'' includes\\n  articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in\\n  English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,\\n  Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.\\n\\n  Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;\\n  less for students under 18 and seniors.

But had\\nforgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here.\\nI generally don\\'t take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I\\'ve\\nfound them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources\\nthat force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some\\npelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much\\nworse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past\\n(~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due\\nto the endometriosis coming back.  I\\'ve tried Synarel, it reduced\\nthe pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately\\nafter I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the\\nonly \"real solution\" to my problem.  Although I don\\'t expect to have\\nany more children, I don\\'t like the idea of having my uterus and\\none remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had\\nthe surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested\\nI get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks\\nthat type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan\\nto have children.  So basically all I\\'m left with is toughing out\\nthe pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something\\nsimilar - but not aspirin, that doesn\\'t work, and Motrin gave me\\nhorrible gastritis a few years ago, so I\\'m through with it).  In\\nfact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take\\nit regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both \\nlegs) as I\\'ll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until\\nI have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes\\nseveral hours for it reduce the pain (it\\'s actually quite effective\\nat reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime\\nI\\'m frequently in severe pain.\\n\\nThe other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in\\nbilateral radiculopathy.  I\\'ve had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs\\n(I\\'ve had 2 of them, and don\\'t intend to ever do that again) with\\nnerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to\\nwhat is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have\\nseveral bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think)\\nit is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan\\nwas that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others\\nhav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations.\\nThe second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation\\ncompared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test,\\ncalled something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the\\n\"internal nerves\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that\\nI sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain\\nis there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there,\\nI need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain\\nto a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9\\nmonths (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I\\'d \\nalways resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently,\\nand primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical\\ntherapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month\\nor so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier,\\nbut it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at\\na lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going\\naway (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which\\ncould be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don\\'t have\\nnearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off\\ntraction about 2 weeks ago.\\n\\nGetting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid\\ntaking analgesic for headaches, I really can\\'t avoid them entirely because\\nI have other pain sources, that \"force\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot\\nto mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery,\\nbut I\\'m avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with,\\noccassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at\\na reduced capacity (I\\'m a systems engineer and do a lot of reading\\nand writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can\\'t concentrate much,\\nI usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because\\nthe pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can\\ncause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric\\nshock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad\\nI can\\'t really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home\\nand in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the\\nmigraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot\\nof migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days.\\nI\\'ve taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so\\nI reduced the dosage), but I don\\'t like the side effects (if I take\\nmore than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will\\neventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn\\'t very helpful when\\nI told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan\\nbecomes available, I should try that.  I\\'ve tried several other medications\\n(fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but\\nthey either didn\\'t work, or I couldn\\'t tolerate them.  So what can I do?\\nMy doctor\\'s seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the\\npain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of\\npain.  I\\'ve had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped\\nonce from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the\\nsuccinylcholine), and I\\'ve already had surgery several times.\\n\\nAnyway, the point of what I\\'m saying is that even if analgesics can contribute\\nto migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.',\n","  '\\n\\n\\nWell, if you want to stick the nose of your car up the ass of a 50 foot semi, I\\nsuppose it\\'s your neck, however, I\\'m not going to let you kill me in the bargain.\\nIf you get frustrated by somebody delaying your inevitable death due to less that\\nwise driving practices, then TOUGH!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thank God for the Fourth of July, for it yearly rids the earth of a considerable\\nload of fools\"',\n","  \"                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n    Don't be so sure, the Blues played the Hawks pretty well this season,\\nand won twice at the Stadium.

There were villages, Kurd/Turk (different Turkic groups)\\n[SY] Georgian (muslim/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother.\\n[SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were \\n[SY] different people. For example, my grandfather would not have been happy \\n[SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not \\n[SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n[SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my\\n[SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these \\n[SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe \\n[SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people,\\n[SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so...\\n\\nThere is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the\\nArmenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno-\\nGeorgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever \\nkilled in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction of\\nAnatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian-\\nGeorgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak after\\nthe Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with the\\nextermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians died\\nin this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of\\npreparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish \\ngenocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometers\\naway!\\n\\n[SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people\\n[SY] around, people assumed that 'Armenians killed us, raped our women',\\n[SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed\\n[SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these \\n[SY] people not to hate all Armenians. \\n\\nI don't follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.\\n\\n[SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region,\\n[SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation.\\n[SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some\\n[SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts.\\n[SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish\\n[SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with\\n[SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately\\n[SY] very easy to start a fire!\\n\\nAgain, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little to\\ndo with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting that\\nthe Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan, \\nand Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through \\nTiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians \\nmilitarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left of\\nCaucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement \\ncaused problems with the locals.

Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves\\n[SY] unattractive! I don't want to go into any graphic detail.\\n\\nMy grandmother's brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women, and paste\\npotato skins on his face to look ugly.

As usual, Sahl\\'s was \\nindependent and sharp as a scalpel.\\n\\tMy effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort\\'s. At \\nleast it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I\\'d mention the \\nidea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for \\ndelivery.\\n\\tThose reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the \\nmost peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are \\nnoted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with \\npassion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in \\nfact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost \\nidentical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German \\nelection). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and \\nenthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their \\nideological quilt.\\n\\tThe last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening \\npages of both books. Hitler\\'s example is when, on page 5, he claims the \\nGerman nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway \\nline between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923) \\nwas \"betrayed to France by a representative of his government\" when \\nthere has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.\\n\\tIn fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as \\nthe Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost \\nsucceeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic \\nclaim in his introduction that \"in a school or during a commencement \\nceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional.\" Of \\ncourse, it\\'s not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of \\nGod against an individual\\'s will that\\'s unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is \\ntoo gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.\\n\\tOf course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books, \\nmy main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern \\nAmerican Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version \\nof Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925), \\nand trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen \\nmillion followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book \\nafter building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in \\nWeimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.\\n\\tThus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh\\'s daily \\nthree-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary \\npropoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way \\nThings Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a \\ntranslation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the \\nprinted word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since \\nradio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of \\nluxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to \\nspend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop \\n$22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.\\n\\tBut, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some \\ncloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of \\ntheir propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these \\ndays.)\\n\\tMort might not know exactly who Rush\\'s equivalent of Rodolf \\nHess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of \\nABC radio and now Limbaugh\\'s partner in EFM Media, the radio \\nprogram\\'s production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk \\nshow, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He \\nknows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows \\nthat Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the \\nopportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh \\nearns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it\\'s almost worthy of a \\nRICO indictment.\\n\\tOn questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of \\nmaterial in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler\\'s venom. For \\nexample:\\n\\nOn Their Own Qualifications to Control Society\\n\\tHitler: \"Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who \\nindividually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly \\nperhaps understand it, one man [author\\'s emphasis] must step forward in \\norder to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of \\nimagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight \\nfor their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of \\nthought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises\" \\n(page 577).\\n\\tLimbaugh: \"Who needs the media when they\\'ve got me? ... The \\nshow is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase \"with half my \\nbrain tied behind my back to make it even\"] denotes the egress of mental \\naptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree \\nwith me ... It might take four or five years, but I\\'m convinced The Media \\nwill slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking \\nand screaming all the way.\" (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)\\n\\nOn Religion as the Basis of a Nation\\n\\tHitler: \"In this world human culture and civilization are \\ninseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his \\ndecline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without \\nculture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord \\nsins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the \\nexpulsion from Paradise.\" (Page 581.)\\n\\tLimbaugh: \"America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... \\nBut our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or \\nambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a \\ncharming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools \\nfor the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of \\nAmerican education has declined ever since?\" (pages 274-5.)\\n\\nOn Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse\\n\\tHitler: \"The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... \\nOne has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and \\ntheatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... \\nTheatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays \\nmust be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the \\nservice of a moral idea of State and culture.\" (pages 346 and 348.)\\n\\tLimbaugh: \"Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that \\nHollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people \\nwho believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality \\nand monagamy. They disparage American heroes.\" (page 254.)\\n\\nOn the News Meida\\n\\tHitler: \"The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of \\ngravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass \\nby in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it\\'s task is only to break the \\npeople\\'s folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of \\nslavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews.\" (Page 331.)\\n\\tLimbaugh: \"Elements of The Media have jumped on the \\nbandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been \\nreplaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During \\nthe Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global \\nnetwork. We can\\'t take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don\\'t \\nrealize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that \\ntherefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided \\nand, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania.\" (pages 270 and 268.)\\n\\n*     *     *\\n\\t\\nTo continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but \\nultimately too depressing to take in one reading.\\n\\tAfter putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that \\nhaunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened \\nGermans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed \\nGermans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s, \\nRush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to \\ndepressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American \\nradical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the \\nReagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for \\nThe Fascist States of America.\\n\\tAnd if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the \\nradical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate.

In my high school days I had been quite involved in the the New  \\nZealand Cadet Forces (This is a bit like ROTC from what I understand of  \\nit, but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training).  \\nThrough this I became extremely enamoured of flying, have become involved  \\nin the sport of gliding, and have a great interest in military aviation  \\nhardware as the very best a \\'real\\' flyer could ask for. My favourite  \\ncomputer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft, both  \\npast and present. \\n\\nI became a Christian about 10 years ago, and at the time rejected all  \\nmilitary activity as immoral. For me, all war was in complete opposition  \\nto God\\'s commandments to love one another, especially one\\'s enemies.\\n\\nDuring the war in Iraq, I found myself with great excitement listening to  \\nthe reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation  \\ntechnology I so admire - The F117A \\'Stealh\\' bomber, the F14, F15 and F16  \\nstrike aircraft, etc. After the war concluded I began to really enjoy  \\nsimulations based around this conflict - Great to go and bomb Saddam\\'s  \\nbio-weapons plants in an F117A on my computer, or shoot down some of his  \\nMig\\'s in an F16. The simulation of the death of people was a wonderful  \\ngame. I imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way.  \\nOne only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact  \\nof war is ignored: A building containing people, or an aircraft flown by a  \\npilot is simply a \\'target\\'. Dead civilians are \\'collateral damage\\'. These  \\neuphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose  \\nsupport are necessary for the continued waging of war - One only has to  \\nlook at Vietnam to see how important public opinion is.\\n\\nNow we see troops sponsored by the United Nations entering Somalia, and  \\nthe prospect of military intervention in the Muslim/Croat/Serb conflict in  \\nthe former Yugoslavia. My revulsion in particular to the siege of  \\nSarajevo, and in the last few days of (sorry \\'bout spelling) Sebrenitsa,  \\nhas caused me to rethink where I stand on \\'justifiable\\' war.\\n\\nI will list several wars in the last 50 years I can look at each, and say  \\n- Yes this may have been justifible, this may not. These are simply my gut  \\nreactions to each - In many cases with the benefit of the impartiality  \\nhistory brings.

I told him  \\nthat if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,  \\nthat there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs  \\nand that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still  \\npretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to  \\nlose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told  \\nhim not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.\\n\\nA couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all  \\napologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus  \\nknock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about  \\nit and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,  \\nand assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....\\n\\nI thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we  \\ndecided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him  \\nback and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the  \\ntruck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the  \\nincident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of  \\nthere in my new truck in about 30 mins.\\n\\nSo, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not  \\nhave happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales  \\nperson talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I  \\nsure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their  \\nmistake.\\n\\nAnyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred  \\ndollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.  \\nI'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.\",\n","  \"***** IBM GAMES FOR SALE OR TRADE *****\\n\\no ADVENTURE\\n\\n  Eric the Unready -- Legend -- $35\\n  King's Quest V -- Sierra -- CD-ROM edition -- $35\\n\\no SPORTS\\n\\n  Michael Jordan In Flight -- Electronic Arts -- $35\\n  Mike Ditka's Ultimate Football -- Accolade -- $30\\n  David Ledbetter's Greens -- Microprose -- $30\\n\\no STRATEGY\\n\\n  Risk -- Virgin -- $10\\n\\n\\nThis software comes with all original packaging and manuals.\\nPrice includes ground shipping to continental US.\\n\\nI will trade for current games; send me your list...\\n\\n--\",\n","  'Fellow netters,\\n\\nI just wanted to let you know that there are a few honest and good people out\\nthere (even outside of Iowa).

Take the body, and if\\nthey get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,\\nGalley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of\\nthem was the closest FLYER to the play.\\n\\nThat's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it\\nwas that scored, much less how.\\n\\nFrom what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart\\nasked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the\\ngame. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised\\nthat a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy \\nSoderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season\\nand, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.\\nBut here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for\\nnumber 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between\\nhim and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????\\n\\nWhat? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...\\n\\n#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.\\nThe difference between the team's record with him and without him is no\\naccident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without\\nRecchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric\\nLindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey\\nnext season.\\n\\n#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,\\nand Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't\\nplay a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family\\nhas a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy\\nSoderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again\\nabout being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.\\n\\n#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season\\nscoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player\\nget as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.\\nNot a tough choice.\\n\\nHonorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total\\nwhich he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line\\nthis year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the\\ndefensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.\\n\\nDimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie\\nmistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling\\nthat with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up\\nanything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman\\nin years to come.\\n\\nGarry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some\\nthings you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,\\nhe certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his\\nwishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive\\ncontribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end\\nwill make him a much more important part of the team next year.\\n\\nBrent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.\\nBut consistency became a problem for him.\\n\\nA couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members:\\n\\nTom Misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange E-mail\\naddresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer.\\nIf you're interested, you can send him mail at:\\n\\natt!ACR.ORG!TMISNIK\\n\\nThe FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning\\npercentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in\\nPatrick), 23-14-5 at home.

I have sometimes tried to put myself\\nin the feet of one of Jesus's disciples.  Basically, they gave up a\\nlot --- career, possibly family, and well, a whole bunch, to follow\\nJesus.\\n\\nSo what is the difference?  It is quite plain.  Jesus was good and\\nDavid Koresh was not.\\n\\nThe problem is, I think, is that we try to legislate what is good\\nand what is bad in terms of principles.  For instance, there are thousands of \\nlaws in the U.S. governing what is legal and what is not.  Often, it is hard\\nto bring people to justice, because it is not possible to find\\na legal way to do it.  If only we could trust judges to be just,\\nthen we could tell them to administer justice fairly, and justice\\nwould be followed.  But since judges don't always get it right,\\nwe have a complicated system involving precedent and bunches\\nof other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect (the justice\\nof man) into something perfect.  But what I hear about the justice\\nsystem in the U.S. tells me that quite the opposite is true.\\n\\nThere is also a problem that we tend to judge the presentation\\nmore than the material being presented.  So we might consider \\na ranting Christian to be bad, but an eloquent person from another\\nreligion to be good.  This goes along with the American desire\\nto protect the Constitution at all costs, even if it allows\\npeople to do bad things. \\n\\nI think that it is the message that is important.  If a man is\\npresenting a false message, even if he is ever ever so mild mannered,\\nthen that man is performing a tremendous disservice.\\n\\nI know that I am rambling here.  I guess that what I am trying to\\nsay is that we shouldn't be looking for principles that tell us\\nwhy the Davidians got it wrong.  It is not wrong to follow and\\nworship a person.  But it is important to choose the right person.\\nIt is simple.  Choose Jesus, and you got it right.  Choose\\nanyone else, and you got it wrong.  Why?  Because Jesus is the\\nbegotten son of God, and nobody else is.  Jesus was without sin, and\\nnobody else was.\",\n","  '\\n    The immunization program is just a \"useful first step\".

This FAQ is so full of error that I\\nmust respond to it.  I hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the\\npartisan theology.\\n\\n\\n1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom\\n4:15 notes that \"where no law is, there is no transgression.\"  Not only\\ndid sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it\\nwas revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).\\n\\n2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise\\nwhich undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the\\npeople, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised\\n\"what ever He says to do we will do.\"  That is why the new covenant is\\nbased on \"better promises\" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law\\nGod promised to \"put my laws in their minds and write them on their\\nhearts\" (Heb. 8:10).\\n\\n3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The\\nSabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt\\nhad been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been\\neven more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly\\nSabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at\\nany time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was\\n*added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).\\n\\n4.  Israel stands for God\\'s people of all time.  That is why God *grafted*\\nthe Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the\\ncovenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises\\nbelong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born\\ninto Israel is not enough \"For they are not all Israel, which are of\\nIsrael\" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says \"if ye be Christ\\'s, then are ye\\nAbraham\\'s seed, and heirs according to the promise.\"  All Christians are\\nAbraham\\'s seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the\\ncriterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the\\npromise God made to all his people the Israelites.\\n\\n\\nPeople would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath\\ncommandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the\\nceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even\\nif you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan\\nsun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed,\\nsanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders\\nagree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in\\nsoc.religion.christian.bible-study).\\nI do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God\\nsays.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law,\\nwhy is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the\\nSabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important\\nenough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that\\nthe message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but\\nfreed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in\\ncourt I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me\\ngrace, do I walk out of the court saying \"I can now go on speeding, for I\\nam now under grace?\"  Being under grace I now drive within the speed\\nlimit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 \"Di we then make void the law through\\nfaith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\"  \"Wherefore the law is\\nholy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\" (Rom. 7:12).\\n\\n\\nDo you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows\\nthat the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did\\nnot go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to\\nAssos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate \"lay by him in store\"\\nwith \"go to a worship service.\"\\n\\nWrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath\\nday of the moral law.\\nWhy would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments\\nwhich conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a\\nGod who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could\\nnot be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a\\nbroken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law\\nbreaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to\\nfollow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to\\nmake false gods, to violate God\\'s name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to\\nkill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight\\nwhen placed next to the word of God.\\n\\nDarius\\n\\n[It\\'s not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I\\nthink Paul\\'s comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is\\nprobably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing\\nwhat he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally\\naccept that those who \"esteem all days alike\" are similarly doing\\ntheir best to honor the Lord.\\n\\nHowever I\\'d like to be clear that I do not think there\\'s unambiguous\\nproof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I\\nindicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.\\n\\nThe difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually\\nabout something else.  They both look like they are talking about\\nnnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says \"and they\\ngathered every Sunday for worship\".  We get various pieces of\\ninformation, but nothing aimed at answering this question.  \\n\\nAct 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple\\nworship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the\\ntemple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of\\nChristians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn\\'t tell us\\nwhat day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius\\'\\nconfusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no\\nreason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the\\nBiblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to\\nme that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn\\'t say they gathered to\\nsee Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread,\\nPaul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that\\'s just not explicit\\nenough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says\\nthat on the first day they should set aside money for Paul\\'s\\ncollection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially\\nto do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can\\'t disprove it,\\nbut the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be\\nwhen they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do\\nit in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day.\\nSo I think the most obvious reading of this is that \"on the first day\\nof every week\" simply means every time they gather for worship.  \\n\\nI think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements\\nis that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian\\nworship was.',\n","  'I am looking for a WINDOW 3.1 driver  for \\n     Cornerstone  DualPage (Cornerstone Technology, Inc) \\nvideo card.

And\\njudging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these\\npolitical groups and organizations, at least here in Greece, the Armenian\\nCause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world.\\n\\nThe International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of\\nthe Armenian Popular Movement, a comparatively new political force headed\\nby younger generations of Armenians, who openly profess their support of the\\narmed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia\\n(ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern\\ncountries and the United States although some of these branches appear to\\nhave gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks\\nof ASALA...\\n\\nVoicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenian\\npeople, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee of\\nthe party and the Greek member of the Permanent People\\'s Tribunal...\\nExplaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement \\nwas Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam \\nAbu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement\\'s continued \\nsupport of the Armenians\\' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause, \\npledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be \\nopen to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later, Mr. \\nAbu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that \\nhis organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that\\nthis policy will continue. \"The doors of our camps are always open to \\nArmenian freedom fighters,\" he affirmed.\\n\\nAmong the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son\\nof Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet;\\ntwo members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the\\nspecific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of\\nthe Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communist\\nparty, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations,\\na number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the\\nEuropean Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among\\nthose who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to follow\\nthe deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens.\\n\\nMore than significant was the large number of messages received by the \\norganizers, including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary\\nMovement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General\\nCommand; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation\\nMovement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist\\nLabor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other\\ninternational groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli-\\nPalestinian conflict.\\n\\n                 SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM\\n\\nAmong messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary\\nFederation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abduction\\nand assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to\\nforeign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the\\nArmenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will\\ncontinue to \"reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,\"\\nto expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag \"Bureau.\"\\nThe message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that\\nexists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement,\\nopen supporters of ASALA and armed struggle.\\n\\nThe Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the\\nGreek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence.\\nThe headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have\\nturned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, who\\nprefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...\\n\\nNow any comment?\\n\\n#From: vd8@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu (Vedat  Dogan)\\n#Subject: Re:Addressing.....\\n#Message-ID: <1993Apr8.233029.29094@news.columbia.edu>\\n\\n \\n \\nn>crap posted by Mr. [(*]!\\n \\n o boy!   \\n \\n Please, can you tell us why those quotes are \"crap\"?..because you do not \\n like them!!!...because they really exist...why?\\n \\n As I said in my previous posting, those quotes exactly exist in the source \\n given by Serdar Argic .. \\n  \\n You couldn\\'t reject it...\\n \\n \\n Here we go again..\\n In the book I have, both the front page and the Author\\'s preface give \\n the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!\\n (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of\\n pages, please ask by sct) \\n \\n \\nI really don\\'t care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924)\\nWhat I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in\\nthe given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your\\ngroundless accussations, etc. \\n \\n[...]\\n \\n \\n I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)\\n and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published\\n in 1934(Serdar Argic\\'s Reference) has..You couldn\\'t reject it..but, now you\\n are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..\\n \\n Let\\'s see how you lie!..(from \\'non-existing\\' quotes to re-publication)\\n \\n First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You\\n called Serdar Argic a liar!..\\n I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...\\n (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could\\'t reject it.)\\n \\n And now, you are lying again and talking about \"modified,re-published book\"\\n(without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..\\n (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was\\n  first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some \\'pretty \\n  well suited theories\\', as usual)\\n \\n And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who\\n wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian\\'s lies...I also give the call number\\n and page numbers again for the library use, which are:  \\n                 949.6 R 198\\n   \\n  and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215\\n              \\n     \\n \\n \\n Now, are you claiming that there can\\'t be such a reference by saying \"it is\\n not possible...\" ..If not, what is your point?\\n \\n Differences in the number of pages?\\n Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic\\'s was in 1934..\\n No need to use the same book size and the same letter \\n charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!\\n \\n The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year\\n first published.. \\n And you tried to hide the whole point..\\n the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about\\n how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given \\n by Serdar Argic exist!! \\n It was the issue, wasn\\'t-it?  \\n \\n you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway? \\n \\n You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a \"crap\"..\\n People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still\\n has so many \"craps\" in the 1993. \\n \\n Any question?\\n \\nSerdar Argic',\n","  \"You might want to clarify the 11 game winning streak.

However, expressing\\n    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well\\n    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far\\n    exceed their technical skills.\\n\\n    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression\\n    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and\\n    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the\\n    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of\\n    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar\\n    representions, a confounded user asks: \"What does it all mean?\"\\n\\n    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and\\n    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by\\n    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media\\n    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic\\n    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for\\n    composing imagery for understanding.\\n\\n    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a\\n    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the\\n    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,\\n    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and\\n    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the\\n    computer graphics context.\\n\\n\\n    FEATURED SPEAKERS INCLUDE:\\n\\n        Psychology/Perception:\\n            Marc De May, University of Ghent\\n            Beverly J.

I am _not_ asking you to take\\nwhat I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get\\nthis book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for\\n_yourself_.\\n\\n\\nIf slavery is _in reality_ (as opposed to in the practice of some\\nMuslims) opposed by Islam, then using slaves for sexual\\npurposes is necessarily opposed too.\\n\\n\\nI understand your point of view, Selim -- I think, rather, it is _us_\\nwho are not getting through to _you_.\\n\\nSome of the points you repeat above I have already answered before.\\n\\nRegarding women, I have made posting after posting on this subject,\\nshowing that Islam is not anti-woman, etc.  However, have you been\\ncompletely ignoring my postings or just missing them?  I just reposted a\\nvery good one, under the title \"Islam and Women\", reposted from\\nsoc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site,\\nthen please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this\\nexcellent article.  \\n\\nIMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.\\n\\nRegarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,\\nwhich is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based\\ncompletely on the Qur\\'an and contains numerous Qur\\'anic verses and\\nhadiths to support its point of view.\\n\\nOur approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical\\nstandpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur\\'an\\nand hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform\\na particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is\\npart of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur\\'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of\\ncourse not.\\n\\nLet me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for\\nyou.  The Qur\\'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says \"I am a\\nMuslim\" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean\\nthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and\\nonly an idiot would think so.\\n\\nDo you see my point?\\n\\n\\nYou are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an\\nideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise\\ntheir wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.\\nTo say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --\\nIslam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be\\ncapitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a\\nfree-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of \\ncapitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)\\n\\n\\nOne can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is\\nbecause Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.\\n\\nSelim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the\\nfallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that\\nIslam => lack of education and power.\\n\\nFor a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a\\nsignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in\\nthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is\\ncompletely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history\\nshows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be\\nother reasons for this situation.\\n\\n\\nWell, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent\\nof your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not\\nknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are\\nfollowing the Qur\\'an or not.\\n\\n\\nThe Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one\\nstage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by \"following the Qur\\'an\"\\nthat Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis\\nthat is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical\\nfact which contradicts your theory. \\n\\n\\nYou have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.\\nSo far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is\\nquite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views\\nmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of\\nthis.\\n\\n\\nI think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.\\n\\n\\nHere too.\\n\\n\\nSelim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate\\nignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly\\nwith respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I\\nthink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!\\n\\nSelim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that\\nyou are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start\\nthinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our\\npostings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously\\nhave.',\n","  '}For those missing the context of this thrilling discussion between\\n}Jim and I, Jim wrote the following to me in e-mail after I pointed out\\n\\nHate to shatter your self image of perfection that  you appear to hold, but\\nyour language is wrong: Jim and me.\\n\\n}I pointed out that I did, in fact, agree that both Robert Weiss and\\n}Jim Meritt took quotes out of context.

Paul adapted the\\nmessage of the Bible to a largely uneducated market. Granted, this\\nmarket still exists today, but do you count yourself as part of it? To\\nbe \"weak in the faith\" is not missing the mark (hamartia) if you do the\\nbest that your education allows. Are you doing the best?\\n\\n\\nLet me make clear that the \"Law\" is none other than the Pentateuch of\\nGenesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. What did Jesus say\\nabout the \"Law\" in Matt5:14-19? Where did Jesus say that the \"Law\" only\\napplies to Jews and that Gentiles are above the \"Law\"?\\n\\n\\nWho acknowledged this fact? On what basis? Are we extra-biblical at this\\npoint? Why not also acknowledge that the Bhagavad-Gita is the only\\nrelevant text for Gentiles, after all we see in the Bible that it was\\nMagus from the east who observed the star-signs of Jesus? Why bother\\nwith any texts at all? Why not just follow whatever the Church has to\\nsay?\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t see how you can say this with a straight face.

Are you saying that\\nthe words of Jesus only apply to Jews?\\n\\n\\nHow Jewish was Paul after he changed his name from Saul?\\n\\n\\nWho says Gentile Christians are not covered by the first five books? Who\\nsays that Gentile Christians are above the Ten Commandments?\\n\\n\\nYou\\'re implying that Jesus\\' words are valid only for Jews. Is this\\nreally what you mean to say? You do realize that you are gutting rather\\nlarge portions of the Bible? When you read Jesus\\' words, did you ever\\nconsider that maybe, just maybe Jesus is talking to you, no matter what\\nyour race or sex? If the Hebrew Scriptures and the Gospel accounts of\\nJesus are only directed to Jews, why were they translated into English?\\n\\n\\nAs Paul would call him, one who was weak in the faith.\\n\\n\\nWhich is more important: 1) The recorded word of Jesus or 2) Indications\\nthat you can deduce from the Bible? Was Jesus God only of the Jews, or\\nGod of all humankind of all race and sex?\\n\\n\\nThis is your understanding of Paul. Compare this to the word of Jesus.\\nAre you Christian or Pauline?\\n\\n\\nAgain, this is your understanding of Paul. Did Jesus say that the Law\\nwas an \"impossible standard?\" Did Jesus say that He superceded the Law?\\nAre you Christian or Pauline?\\n\\n\\nYou acknowledge that it is *your* reading of Paul. What did Jesus say?\\nCan you deny that Matt5:14-19 is quite clear in its meaning? Are you \\nChristian or Pauline?\\n\\n\\nWhen did Jesus say that the purpose of the Law was conviction of sin?\\n\\n\\nPlease reread Matt5:14-19. Are you Christian or Pauline?\\n\\n\\nAre you saying that the Ten Commandments are ceremonial details?\\n\\n\\nYou call observance of the Sabbath, the day on which the Lord rested,\\nceremonial? Has circumcision been superceded for Christians?\\n\\n....\\n\\nAre you Christian or Pauline?\\n\\n[Both.  There is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is\\nnot, at least not in this case.  Jesus did not deal explicitly with\\nthe question of whether the Law was binding on Gentiles.  That\\'s why I\\nhave to cite evidence such as the way Jesus dealt with the Centurion.\\n\\nAs to general Jewish views on this, I am dependent largely on studies\\nof Pauline theology, one by H.J. Schoeps, and one whose author I can\\'t\\ncome up with at the moment.  Both authors are Jews.  Also, various\\nChristian and non-Christian Jews have discussed the issue here and in\\nother newsgroups.\\n\\nMat 5:19 is clear that the Law is still valid.  It does not say that\\nit applies to Gentiles.\\n\\nAnd yes, I say that the specific requirement for worship on the\\nSabbath in the Ten Commandments is a ceremonial detail, when you\\'re\\nlooking at the obligations of Gentiles.  Similarly circumcision.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure quite what else I can say on this subject.  Again, it\\'s\\nunfortunate the Jesus didn\\'t answer the question directly.  However we\\ndo know (1) what the 1st Cent.

And I expressly set up a whole thread,\\nYOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.\\n\\nDean again:\\n\\n\"You made an ass of yourself\\nby saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was\\nsomehow an attempt to \"paint Jews as plaster saints,\" thereby\\nrevealing your inability to understand the discussion as well\\nas showing your dislike for people saying positive things\\nabout Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by\\nrepeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then\\nclaiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge.\"\\n\\nActually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew\\nwho gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite\\naccording to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturing\\nJewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as\\nimplicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.\\n\\nI went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit of\\nthe doubt in a post following my initial crack about \"plaster saints\", \\nsuggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.\\n\\nIn an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incredibly\\ndistorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as\\nthe basis of one insult after another.',\n","  '\\n\\nYour comment here is meant as a put down. It fails for several reasons :\\n\\n1) You have edited out the context of the action under discussion. \\n2) I never brought the legal definition up. I use the English language\\nand not the legal dialect. The legal definition of fraud changes from\\none country to another in any case. The context of the discussion is morality\\nof censorship.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou are extrapolating from the statement I made concerning a circumstance\\nin which such an act of censorship would be permissable to the Teel case.\\nIf you had bothered to read the post instead of trying to prove how stupid you\\nthought me you would have done rather better. The mode of argument I was using\\nwas a form of rhetoric. Argument by example, I describe a wide set of\\ncircumstances in which an action is permisable and demonstrate that they\\ndo not apply, thus the action is not permisable.\\n\\nObviously a company posting from a University adress would be squashed,  it\\nwould be contrary to the internet comercial use.\\n\\n\\nNow you are clutching at straws. In the context of the discussion it was\\nthe fact of association between the company and the post that was important.\\nThe typeface etc is inconsequential.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you are implying that I am lying I suggest you read Mark Holohan and Ulick\\nStaffords posts into soc.culture.british. If you are suggesting that \\nadvocating murder is a trivial matter I would prefer that you state it\\ndirectly. \\n\\nCertainly I oppose the right of Dr Sidiqui and the Ayatolah Khomenhi to\\ncall for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Incitement to murder is not part\\nof what I consider legitimate freedom of speech.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat is irrelevant, the case is not the incremental cost but the facility\\ncost. If I decide that a company I am associated with should subscribe\\nto USEnet that usenet connection is the property of the company. It is\\nquite legitimate for a company to have a political or other agenda and\\nregulate the use of its property in accordance with its policy. For example\\nif a Microsoft employee were to post \"Windows NT is crap don\\'t buy it\"\\nfrom a Microsoft machine I would consider it reasonable for Microsoft to\\nsack that employee. In the same way if a company decides that it has \\npolitical objectives it might wish to regulate postings in a political\\nmanner. This is no worse than Rupert Murdoch using his papers as a political\\nplatform for his views.\\n\\n\\n\\nah yes you did not quote them, merely refered to them.\\n\\n\\n\\nYour article consisted of a reference to the first ammendment, your signature\\nand pretty well damn all else. \\n\\n\\n\\nAre you refering to the initial hearings on an injunction or the judgments\\non the substantive case?\\n\\nThe initial hearings that the government won were judged on the not unresonable\\njudgment that assertion by the government that the national interest might be\\nharmed would be grounds for prior restraint. The second set of hearings on the\\nsubstance judged that the government had no case and that the official secrets\\nact could not be used to suppress information in thwe public domain already.\\nThe part that they won was over the copyright issue which is rather separate.\\n\\nHere again the issue of censorship is rather different in the case that\\ninformation is divulged on the understanding that it will not be communicated\\nto third parties. The first ammendment certainly does not apply in this\\ncase as the numerous prosecutions of spies in the US proves. \\n\\nThe crux of the Spycatcher affair was extrateritoriality of British law.\\nThe censorship aspect of it arose as a result of the government\\'s\\nludicrous attempts to prevent summary of the case in the book. \\n\\n\\n\\nFunny I saw that as a rejection of an assertion that you had made. Of course in\\nrejecting an assertion I have to make a contrary assertion, since this assertion\\nis unprovable I left it at that. \\n\\nSo far I have not seen you demonstrate a command of the contrary opinion to your\\nown. You are attacking my anti-censorship view because I dare to accept the\\nvalidity of some pro-censorship arguments while rejecting their conclusions. \\nPlus I am not an absolutist.

Paul makes a clear claim that we are to continue straining for\\nthe prize over in Philippians 3:10-16.  Only by not living out the\\ncommands do we stagnate and become lukewarm, to be spit out by Jesus.\\nAs it says in 1 John 5:3:  \"This is love for God:  to obey his comands.\"\\nThat obedience is our straining to achieve for God.  Of course, this\\nrequires work on our part.\\n\\nAs for the quote in James, Satan doesn\\'t care what we believe.  What\\nmatters is the results of our belief (works).  If one truly has faith in\\nwhat one believes, one will either act on that faith or be lying to\\noneself about believing in the first place.  \\n\\nStan, as for your first line, you have a very good point.  Obedience by\\nobligation (grudgery) is not what God desires.  Instead, look at how\\nmany times the Bible talks about being joyous in all situations and when\\ndoing God\\'s work.  Being begrudged by the work has no value.  Also, we\\nshould do the work necessary whenever we can, not just when we feel\\nJesus\\' presence.  Feelings can deceive us.  However, as Paul states to\\nTimothy in 2 Timothy 4:2:  \"Preach the Word; be prepared in season and\\nout of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and\\ncareful instruction.\"  Also, remember that Paul tells Timothy in 1\\nTimothy 4:16:  \"Watch your life and doctrine closely.  Persevere in\\nthem, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.\"\\nSo, in order to do the work necessary, we need to be sure that we are\\ncorrect first.  Remember Jesus\\' warning in Matthew 7:3-5 not to be\\nhypocritical about what we do.  The best way to accomplish this is to be\\na disciple completely in both thought and deed.

Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.\\n\\nGrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-\\nline/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.\\n\\nGrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel\\nprojections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing\\noff for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain\\nwhat it all means later on). \\n\\nGrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with\\ndata so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines\\nto do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so\\nyou don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)\\n\\nGrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above \\nprocessors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.\\nBoth versions are *100% source compatibel*. \\n\\nGrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D\\ngraphics and how to use the package.\\n\\nIf demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. \\nHowever, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for\\na lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.\\n\\nGrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage.

The scribe Matthew is perhaps\\nthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in\\nthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew\\'s main\\nstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even\\nabout the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in\\nthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the\\nauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at\\nleast 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much\\nhappened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we\\nwill take particular claims at face value.\\n\\nImmanuel:\\n\\n       We begin, of course, at the beginning.\\n\\n       (Mt 1.21-22):  \"[Mary] will bear a son, and you,\\n       Joseph, will name him \\'Jesus\\' (which means G\\'d is\\n       salvation), for he will save his people from their\\n       sins.\"  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had\\n       spoken by a prophet:\\n\\n       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),\\n       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made\\n       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not\\n       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz\\n       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its\\n       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the\\n       lord G\\'d said to Isaiah, \"go to meet with Ahaz...\" \\n       ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,\\n       naturally) saying, \"Ask a sign of G\\'d your lord.  It\\n       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.\"  But,\\n       Ahaz said, \"I won\\'t ask; I will not put the lord to a\\n       test.\"  Then (Isaiah) said, \"Hear then, O house of\\n       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that\\n       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord\\n       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman\\n       is with child and will bear a son, and name him\\n       \"Immanuel,\" which means, \"G\\'d is with us.\"   He will\\n       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil\\n       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to\\n       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings\\n       you dread will have been deserted...\\n\\nMatthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. \\nFurther, he the Hebrew word \"almah,\" (young woman), as\\nspecifically, \"virgin.\"  But, this is not a prophecy about the\\nMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years\\nlater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In\\nshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of\\ncontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It\\nshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general\\nmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,\\nvirgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,\\nthe fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by\\nlater Christians to be G\\'d walking among men, was never called by\\nthe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy\\nfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second\\nclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.\\n\\nEgypt:\\n\\n       After Jesus\\'s birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a\\nquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he\\nwishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an\\nalleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.\\n\\n       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of\\n       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:\\n       \"Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.\"\\n\\n\\nWhat the lord really said was this.\\n\\n       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him. \\n       And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called\\n       them (my people), the more they went from me; they\\n       kept sacrificing to the Ba\\'als, and kept burning\\n       incense to idols.\\n\\nMatthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea\\'s oracle.  But, it\\nwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to\\nreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of\\nhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind\\nup with a Jesus that flees and resists G\\'d.   Again, this prophecy\\nis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.\\n\\nRachel Weeps:\\n\\n        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that\\nKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of\\nall young male children.  Matthew then writes,\\n\\n       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the\\n       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:\\n\\n       \"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud\\n       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;\\n       she refused to be consoled, because they were\\n       no more.\"   \\n\\nThe reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the\\ncarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722\\nBCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,\\nand Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are \"no\\nmore.\"  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies\\nbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.\\n       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who\\nwas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and\\nBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her \"children,\"\\nit is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is\\nthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,\\n\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\"\\n       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely\\nthat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the\\nevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,\\nnor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. \\nHerod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less\\nevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a\\nprime example of how events were added to Jesus\\'s life to enhance\\nthe message of the church\\'s gospel.\\n       Because of the whole story\\'s similarity to the tale of the\\ninfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set\\nup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.\\nIt is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention\\nthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The \"children\" the prophet\\nspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G\\'d\\ncomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be\\nreturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this\\nwould not suit Matthew\\'s purpose, as the children he speaks of are\\ndead for good.  Again, the \"prophecy\" Matthew sets up is not even\\nthat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too\\nconvincing.\\n\\nThe Nazarene:\\n\\n       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find\\nanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife\\ntake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth, \\n\\n       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets\\n       might be fulfilled, \"He shall be called a Nazarene.\"\\n\\nFirst thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of\\nthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who \"He\" is. \\nThere are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,\\nthere are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still\\nworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at\\nall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson\\'s mother that\\nshe will,\\n\\n       [Judges 13.5]  \"...conceive and bear a son.  No razor\\n       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his\\n       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel\\n       from the hands of the Philistines.\"\\n\\nThis is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G\\'d. \\nBut, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has\\nbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is\\nsimple making them up now.\\n\\nBearing our\\nDiseases:\\n\\n       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses\\nand disabilities.\\n\\n       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the\\n       prophet Isaiah, \"He took our infirmities and bore our\\n       diseases.\"\\n\\nAs expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,\\nand a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,\\n\\n       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has\\n       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.\\n\\nFrom a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that\\nthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation\\nof Israel, Jehovah\\'s chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the\\nIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations\\nthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish\\nidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the\\ninstrument of the nations\\' salvation by G\\'d.\\n      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which\\nare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and\\ndiscipline.  They do not speak of a \"servant\" going around and\\nhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the\\nsicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,\\nas we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The\\nverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but\\nrather something that had already happened.  While it is believed\\nthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear\\nthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say\\nthat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his\\nspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew\\'s parallel\\nmisses where he intended it to have its effect.\\n\\n\\nSilent Messiah:\\n\\n      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus\\nordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn\\'t arouse\\nthe attention of the local rulers.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by\\n       the prophet Isaiah.   \\n\\n       \"Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,\\n       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on\\n       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He\\n       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear\\n       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised\\n       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings\\n       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his\\n       name.\"\\n\\nThe Isaiah passage quoted reads,\\n\\n       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my\\n       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my\\n       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the\\n       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or\\n       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a\\n       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will\\n       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail\\n       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has\\n       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands\\n       await his law.\\n\\nYou see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,\\nbecause it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could\\nnever think of Jesus failing, never would the \"light\" of mankind\\nburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to\\nan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace\\nG\\'d there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will\\nbe the children of G\\'d.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed\\nfrom the Judaic \"...the coastlands await his law.\" to the\\nChristologic, \"the Gentiles will hope in his name.\"   While the\\noriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it\\nto fit its strange doctrine of \"believing in the name.\"  If one\\nhas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only\\nto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved\\nbut blind and imperfect servant, \"a people robbed and\\nplundered...\"   So, we see that when Matthew\\'s attempt at\\n\"prophecy\" is examined, it crumbles.\\n\\nThree Days and\\nThree Nights:\\n\\n      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very\\nmouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and\\nresurrection.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the\\n       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son\\n       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and\\n       three nights.\\n\\nBefore any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know\\nhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was\\n24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset\\n6pm.  What was referred to as a \"day\" was the period of light from\\n6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time\\nscale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until\\n6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their\\nsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. \\n(It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn\\'t forget that\\nSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,\\nwhen days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight\\nportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,\\nJesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise\\nunresurrected for three days and three nights.\\n\\n      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the \"ninth\\nhour,\" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the\\ngrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, \"rose,\"\\nbefore dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was\\nover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for\\nclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before\\n6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm\\nFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means\\nusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two\\nnights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this\\nis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we\\nare even able to have his death involve three days and three\\nnights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to\\nsuspect that this error is another one of Matthew\\'s little\\nmistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his\\ngod\\'s mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more\\nthan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.\\n\\nHearing &\\nUnderstanding:\\n\\n     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in\\nparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if\\nyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the\\nmessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the\\nparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand\\nthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not\\naccept the \"plain\" message any better.  Matthew says,\\n\\n       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in\\n       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says, \\n\\n       \"You will indeed hear but never understand; and you\\n       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this\\n       people\\'s heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of\\n       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they\\n       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and\\n       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal\\n       them.\"\\n\\nThe original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his\\ncall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is\\nflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. \\nIsaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G\\'d,\\ncalling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.\\n\\n       [Is 6.9-13]  And G\\'d said, \"Go, and say to this\\n       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and\\n       see, but do not perceive.\\'   Make the heart of this\\n       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their\\n       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear\\n       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and\\n       turn and be healed.\"  Then Isaiah said, \"How long,\\n       lord?\"  And he said, \"Until the cities lie waste\\n       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the\\n       land is utterly desolate, and the G\\'ds take men far\\n       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And\\n       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned\\n       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still\\n       stands when the tree is felled.\" The holy seed is its\\n       stump.\\n\\nHere we see that it is really G\\'d who causes the people of Israel\\nto stop listening to the prophet\\'s warnings, but reaffirms the\\npromise made to Solomon\\'s (and David\\'s) seed/lineage.  If you read\\nthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan\\nof G\\'d to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look\\nat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)\\n     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion\\nof Isaiah\\'s verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,\\nhe has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn\\'t\\nunderstand Jesus\\'s stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah\\'s verses are\\nnot prophecies, but rather commands from G\\'d to him, in the\\npresent.   Once again, Matthew\\'s prophecy falls flat on its face. \\n\\n     Matthew tries again to make Jesus\\'s parables look like they\\nhave the prophetic approval.\\n\\n       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a\\n       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the\\n       prophet, \"I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I\\n       will utter that which has been hidden since the\\n       foundation of the world.\"\\n\\nMatthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a\\nprophet, but from the Psalms.\\n\\n       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will\\n       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have\\n       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. \\n       We will not hide them from their children, but tell to\\n       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the\\n       lord...\\n\\nAs was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come\\nfrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies\\nof Matthew\\'s gospel even inserted Isaiah\\'s name as this prophet. \\nApparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some\\nof it up.\\n     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once\\nagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus\\nhas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not\\nunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. \\nFurther, they speak of things \"known, that our fathers have told\\nus.\"  Jesus deals with things \"hidden since the foundation of the\\nworld.\"  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. \\nThis is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No\\nwonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,\\nMatthew\\'s artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,\\nChristians rarely look at this.  Matthew\\'s prophecies aren\\'t the\\nonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.\\n\\n\\nExcuses of\\nLittle Faith:\\n\\n       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go\\naround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what\\nepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were\\npossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were\\nunable to \"dispossess\" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more\\nenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying\\nthey didn\\'t have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this\\ndemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or\\nhe does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move\\nmountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can\\nmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the\\nCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to\\nMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old\\nwoman\\'s arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.\\n\\n       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in\\nancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their\\nsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in\\nheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and\\ntheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.  \\n\\n     Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time\\nor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the\\nold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the\\ntheologians give are various excuses as to why we don\\'t get to see\\nGod anymore.\\n\\n       We\\'re too lazy; we\\'re not zealous enough; we\\'re\\n       sinful; it\\'s just his \"plan\"; we put too many of our\\n       own demands on G\\'d\\'s appearance; if we had the right\\n       faith, if we  were willing to meet G\\'d on his terms...\\n\\n     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G\\'d.  You, dear\\nreader, have not seen G\\'d.  Not literally, you know that to be\\ntrue. (I know that\\'s presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your\\nheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we\\'ve seen religions do is\\nmake people feel good and content about not seeing G\\'d.  They say\\nour little faith does not merit us to see G\\'d.  Sometimes, they\\nsay, \"See the love in these people you worship with... see the\\nlives of people change... that is seeing G\\'d.\"   Thus people get\\nlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G\\'d into the everyday\\nsights.   But, that is not seeing G\\'d as I am speaking of... it is\\nnot seeing G\\'d the way people used to see.  \\n      What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of\\nhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the\\nforgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created\\nby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are\\nwhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody\\nhas little faith.\\n\\x0c\\nJesus Rides on\\nan Ass:\\n\\n       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah\\nking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into\\nJerusalem.  \\n\\n       [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken\\n       by the prophet, saying,\\n\\n       Tell the daughter of Zion, \"Behold, your king is\\n       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a\\n       ass-colt.\"\\n\\nOf course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little\\ndifferently.\\n\\n       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and\\n       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-\\n       colt... he will command peace to the nations.\\n\\nThere isn\\'t all that much difference here, except that Zechariah\\nonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the\\npoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for\\nboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew\\'s version, we get a\\ncomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two\\ndonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,\\nproctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written\\nearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to\\nJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and\\nshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has\\nbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I\\nhave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,\\nthe situation is often reversed nowadays...\\n\\n       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were\\nangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,\\nJesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,\\n\\n       [Mt 21.16]  Haven\\'t you read?  `Out of the mouth of\\n       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.\\'\\n\\nIt is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus\\nwas never one to point out such little \"prophetic\" things AND\\nsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to\\nfit Matthew\\'s track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or\\nMatthew, \"Haven\\'t you read?\" for the source reads,\\n\\n       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is\\n       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is\\n       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you\\n       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the\\n       enemy and the avenger.\\n\\nThe passages hardly need comment.  There is no \"perfect praise\"\\nspoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G\\'d,\\nnot his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be\\njust one more case of Matthew\\'s pen making up convenient prophetic\\nscripture.\\n\\nYHVH said to \\nmy lord...:\\n\\n      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish\\nmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king\\nDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,\\n\\n       \"The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until\\n       I put your enemies under your feet.\"\\n\\nTaken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic\\ndescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of\\ncourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to\\nmake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine\\nnature of the messiah-king.  It\\'s tempting to believe this, if one\\nis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. \\nBut, there are problems.\\n       In Jesus\\'s time, the psalm was thought to be about the\\nmessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the\\nmessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures\\nabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,\\nbringing the Jews to times even better than those under David\\'s\\nrule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the\\npassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the\\nChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this\\npsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus\\'s time had\\nalso made.  One must remember that there were various factions\\namong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the\\nmessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like\\nhis audience, who thought the messiah\\'s advent was imminent, and\\nwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.\\nWhat is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,\\n\\n       YHVH\\'s utterance to my lord:\\n\\t\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your\\n       footstool.\"\\n\\n       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule\\n       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer\\n       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the\\n       holy mountains.  \\n\\n       \"You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek\\n       forever.\"\\n\\nThe word \"lord\" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian\\nbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the\\nword is \"adoni,\" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means\\n\"lord,\" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in\\nthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G\\'d.  It is merely an\\naddress of respect.  \\n      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word\\nrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is\\nsupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the\\npsalm translates to either \"a psalm of David,\" or \"a psalm about\\nDavid.\"  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court\\npoet, about David\\'s covenant and endorsement from G\\'d.  If the\\npsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be\\ntalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended\\nfrom David, was not present in David\\'s age.  We have extensive\\ntales of David\\'s doings and sayings-- none of which include any\\npraises of a messiah.\\n     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after\\nDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G\\'d had put his show of\\nfavour for David\\'s kingdom on hold.  \\n     The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was\\npromised by G\\'d a rise to power, victory over his enemies,\\nsuccessful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved\\nthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,\\nenabled to bless the people.   It all fits.\\n      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,\\nthough.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though\\nhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this\\nevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off\\na little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,\\nthough, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of\\nMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. \\nMatthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of\\nan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus\\'s question.  As we\\nmight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by\\nembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.\\n\\nMoses & Jesus,\\nHad it Together\\nAll Along...:\\n\\n       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a\\npseudo-prophecy in John\\'s gospel.  The gospel story of John\\ndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed\\nfrom the real events of Jesus\\'s career as told by even Matthew. \\nBut, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early\\nchurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah\\nking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made\\nby G\\'d.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of\\na promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this\\nwas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the\\nChristians who came along later decided that they would claim the\\nfulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the\\npromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.\\n\\n       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,\\n       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.\\n\\nIt would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,\\nAbraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. \\nI have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament\\nwhich corresponds to John\\'s little prophecy.  It is par for the\\ncourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like\\nhis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has\\nmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they\\nstill cling to it.\\n\\nThe Potter\\'s\\nField:\\n\\n      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by\\none of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,\\n\\n       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver\\n       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief\\n       priests, taking the silver, said, \"It isn\\'t lawful for\\n       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood\\n       money.\"  So they... bought a potter\\'s field with it to\\n       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was\\n       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,\\n\\n       \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price\\n       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the\\n       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter\\'s\\n       field, as the lord directed me.\"\\n\\nThis prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament\\nScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name\\nof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which\\nMatthew makes use of.\\n\\n       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,\\n       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, \"Cast\\n       them to the treasury,\" --the lordly price at which I\\n       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of\\n       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of\\n       YHVH.\\n\\nFirst of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer\\nof the messiah, or of G\\'d.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely\\na priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people\\nshortly before G\\'d would send Judah and Israel into conflict with\\none another.  The word, \"treasury,\" had been replaced by the King\\nJames Scholars with \"to the potter,\" precisely because this made\\nMatthew\\'s quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The\\ncorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed \"treasury,\" which also\\nmakes perfect sense in Zechariah\\'s context, whereas \"potter\\'s\\nfield\" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was\\nintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given\\nMatthew\\'s track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of\\nintentional dishonesty.\\n      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the\\ntext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas\\'s situation, and if\\nas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard\\nthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to\\ntoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah\\ndirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high\\npriests.  The high priests would not put the money in the\\ntreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the\\nopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,\\nthe \"prophecy\" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New\\nTestament face value.  To those, Matthew\\'s work is convincing\\nenough.\\n\\nWine, Vinegar,\\n& Casting Lots:\\n\\n      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.\\n\\n       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,\\n       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not\\n       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they\\n       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that\\n       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,\\n\\n       \"They parted my garments among them, and upon my\\n       vesture did they cast lots.\"\\n\\nFirst of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour\\nwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find\\nthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him\\nsome to drink --not polluted with gall.\\n\\n       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, \"I thirst.\"  A bowl of\\n       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the\\n       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he\\n       had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is finished;\"\\n\\nBut, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the\\nprophets, but one from the Psalms.\\n\\n       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;\\n       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me\\n       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and\\n       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add\\n       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no\\n       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the\\n       Book of the Living.\\n\\nOf course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request\\nof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm\\nquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It\\nis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that\\nwe run into further problem when we see that the \"Jesus\" in the\\npsalm asks G\\'d for the damnation of the \"crucifiers,\" whereas the\\nJesus of the gospels says,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, the\\n       don\\'t know what they do!\"\\n\\nFurther, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by\\nhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus\\'s drink, not his\\nmeat, as the psalm stipulates.\\n\\n       With the \"prophecy\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally\\nask, \"What of the casting of lots?\"  This brings up the 22nd\\nPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to\\nsay that the fact that Jesus\\'s clothes were divided as told is no\\ngreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon\\nin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least\\nerroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does\\nindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of\\nJesus\\'s clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,\\nhis ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some\\nsuspicions.\\n\\nThe 22nd Psalm:\\n\\n      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his\\ncondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of\\npraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it\\nseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We\\nwill examine the primary passages.\\n\\n       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! \\n       Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words\\n       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you\\n       don\\'t answer, and by night, but find no rest.\\n\\nJesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. \\nThis suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather\\nthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not\\nfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as\\ncomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like \"the\\nlamb led mute before its shearers.\"  Indeed, Jesus doesn\\'t do much\\ngroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by\\nboth day and night on the cross.\\n\\n       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... \\n       All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag\\n       their heads;  \"He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let\\n       him deliver him... for he delights in him.\"\\n\\nThis seems to fit Jesus\\'s execution pretty well, with the\\nexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.\\n\\n       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their\\n       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.\\n\\n       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and\\n       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my\\n       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.\\n\\n       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my\\n       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the\\n       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my\\n       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!\\n\\nIt would seem quite convincing, and I\\'m sure the early Christian\\nfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,\\nthis prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words \"have pierced\" really\\ndo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,\\n\\n       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my\\n       hands and feet...\\n\\nIn Hebrew the phrase \"like the lion\" and a very rare verb form\\nwhich can mean \"pierced\" differ by one phonetic character.  The\\nword in the Hebrew text is literally, \"like the lion\" (ka\\'ari),\\nwhich makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal\\nimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that\\nwould urge a Christian to change the word to \"ka\\'aru.\"   But, to\\nadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \"prophecy\" this is\\njust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the\\ncorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to\\nJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the\\ntranslators.\\n\\n       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend\\nitself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being\\nsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the\\npsalm\\'s true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know\\nthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather\\nthe forearms.  This doesn\\'t say much in favour of the traditional\\nthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on\\nhis palms.  But then, facts aren\\'t bound by our religious beliefs.\\n\\n      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not\\nattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord\\nJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all\\nthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories and\\ninterpretations of Jesus\\'s life and death.  How much these\\nscriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down\\nis a question that has serious repercussions for Christian\\ntheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful\\nfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might\\nhave been \"enhanced\" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,\\nit does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural\\nmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good\\nthings for St. Matthew.\\n\\nThe reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus\\'s\\ncrucifixion.  John\\'s gospel recount, written about 70 years after\\nthe fact, tells us at Jesus\\'s execution,\\n\\n       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his\\n       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...\\n       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...\\n       \"The will look on him whom they\\'ve pierced.\"\\n\\nOf course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of\\ncontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of\\nIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with\\nthem.\\n\\n       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...\\n       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations\\n       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will\\n       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on\\n       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have\\n       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him\\n       like you weep over a firstborn child.\\n\\nJohn\\'s attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that\\nMatthew\\'s attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more\\nthan just one passage.  John\\'s errors are grossly obvious and\\nblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel\\nwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their\\nreligion were founded.\\n\\n\\x0c\\nReckoned with\\nTransgressors:\\n\\n       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming\\nthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of\\nthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.\\n\\n       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,\\n       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the\\n       scripture was fulfilled which says,\\n\\n       \"He was reckoned with the transgressors.\"\\n\\nHere, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,\\nabout the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the\\nmessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its\\nsurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The\\nverses are also about what this servant has gone through in the\\npast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The\\nservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the\\ndescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the\\nmessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between\\ntwo thieves would fulfill the \"prophecy\" in Isaiah.  Jesus would\\nmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was\\nconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his\\ncareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to\\nsteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could\\nhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.\\n\\n       Mark goes on to tell us how \"those who were crucified with\\n[Jesus] also reviled him.\" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a\\ncouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke\\ndecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged\\n       with him railed, \"Aren\\'t you the messiah?! Save\\n       yourself, and us!\"\\n\\nThis certainly fits with Mark\\'s recount, which tells how the\\npeople who crucified Jesus said, \"Save yourself!\" and that the\\nrobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,\\n\\n       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,\\n       \"Don\\'t you fear G\\'d, since you are under the same\\n       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,\\n       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. \\n       But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,\\n       \"Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.\" \\n       And Jesus answered, \"Verily I say to you, today you\\n       will be with me in paradise.\"\\n\\nNow, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches\\nthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking\\nhis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather\\nstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his\\npunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,\\napparently noble and of principle, doesn\\'t seem likely to have\\nbeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by\\nLuke.  Of course, Luke\\'s recount also disagrees with Mark\\'s.  \\nLuke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy\\nenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made\\nup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free\\nwords of G\\'d do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another\\nexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and\\nexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,\\nthe embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have\\nseen.\\n\\nThe End of the\\nWorld--\\n       Mt. 24:\\n\\n       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and\\nembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all\\nthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most\\nunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus\\nmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and\\nhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world\\nwhich he has been warning about.\\n\\n       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple\\'s\\n       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your\\n       coming, and of the close of the age?\\n\\n       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for\\n       many will come in my name, saying, \"I am the christ.\"  \\n       ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for\\n       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,\\n       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the\\n       beginning of the birthpangs.\\n             They will deliver you up... put you to death,\\n       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.\\n       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This\\n       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a\\n       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.\\n             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the\\n       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to\\n       the mountains.\\n\\n             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,\\n       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from\\n       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man\\n       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,\\n       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out\\n       his angels... and gather his elect...\\n             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its\\n       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know\\n       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these\\n       things, you will know that He is near, at the very\\n       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not\\n       pass away until all these things take place...\\n             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the\\n       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,\\n       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming\\n       at an hour you do not expect.\\n\\nFrom this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in\\nwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells\\nthem that although he doesn\\'t know the exact day or hour, that it\\nwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet\\ntheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. \\nBut, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his\\ndisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,\\nand that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be\\nswept away.\\n      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant\\nnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, \"this generation\\nshall not pass away...\" really means \"this race of people will not\\npass away...\"  Of course, the word for generation is used many\\ntimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. \\nIt is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,\\nhe didn\\'t learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is\\nquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at\\nleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. \\nThe charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking\\nat the Apostles\\' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from\\nRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus\\nmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.\\n\\n       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th\\nchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000\\nyears, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,\\nhearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. \\nSurely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how\\ntired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for\\njust the right moment to spring?\\n\\n\\n       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,\\n(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or\\nthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three\\neternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for\\nless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine\\nradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn\\'t in the best\\ninterests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore\\ndisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. \\nAs has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when\\npeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,\\nJesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have\\nseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout\\nChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple\\nbelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with\\nargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away\\nfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been the\\neasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the\\nprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely\\naccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. \\nPausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity\\nhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support\\nwars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which\\nChristianity can securely keep hold.',\n","  '\\n\\n\\n\\n         When did Bill start doing endorsements?\\n\\n         Will he do the \"Remington Shaver\" ad?',\n","  '\\n\\n\\tI thought NEC and Toshiba CD-ROM mechanism have an average \\naccess time of less than 200 ms.

Michael\\nSiemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolution\\nof an argument over them turns on secular and cultural\\nassumptions that are independent of these rules.\\n \\n\\nThe commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed,\\nin part, as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if\\nhe has \"ultimate responsibility.\" Indeed, many traditions present\\nan interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret\\nloving one\\'s neighbor as following various other rules, and\\nrelying on their god to make things come out right, precisely\\nbecause it would be wrong for man to assume such \"ultimate\\nresponsibility.\" Once again, we are confronted with good sounding\\ngoo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean. \\n\\n\\nAnd who is to say that this interpretation is \"twisted\"?  There\\nare many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward\\nreading show the Christian god behaving in just this way.\\nMichael cannot refer to \"base\" claims or base commandments to\\nshow that such readings are \"twisted,\" because this divergence in\\nunderstanding occurs even in trying to interpret the \"base\"\\nclaims and commandments.  In addressing conservative Christians,\\nMichael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions\\nthat these conservative Christians will reject.  \\n\\n\\nBut these base commandments are too vague to serve as  \"a\\nprinciple for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems.\" The meaning of\\nthese base commandments for any believer derives from the secular\\nand cultural notions that the believer brings to them, from how\\nthe believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings of\\nother Biblical passages, from a particular sectarian tradition,\\nor from some combination of these things.  These commandments\\nlack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for\\ncriticizing ethical systems.  What meaning they have comes from\\nthe ethical system the believer brings to these commandments. \\n\\n\\nJesus explicitly states that this summarizes Jewish law, which\\nwould seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what\\nit means to love God and love our neighbors.  There are *many*\\nparables and teachings the gospels attribute to Jesus that are\\nstraightforwardly read as ethical commandments.  The Pauline\\nepistles are similarly full.  If it is not clear that these all\\ncome together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior,\\nthe problem is *not* a lack of raw material. \\n\\n-*----\\n\\nNo, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel \\nseriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the\\ngospel.\\n\\n\\nIn a sense, the wide variety of interpretations does tell us\\nsomething about Christianity.  It tells us that the New Testament\\nauthors left a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serve\\nas the source text for many, vastly different beliefs about the\\nnature of the Christian god and about what men should and\\nshouldn\\'t do. \\n\\nThe irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per\\nse that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and\\ngays.  *Every* Christian principle he turns to this cause is\\neffective only through the extra-Christian principles through\\nwhich Michael interprets his religion, and the homophobes apply\\nthe *same* Christian principles, with equal justification, to\\ntheir cause.  In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that\\nmake Michael\\'s Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would\\nbe as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by\\nChristian interpretation.  \\n\\nMichael paints a picture of \"standard American atheism\" as the\\nrejection of the evil in many conservative Christian\\ninterpretations of the Bible.  But I think it is even more\\ndamaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament presents\\nsuch a vague hodge-podge of notions about the nature of God and\\nthe nature of the good (except, of course, when it is ordered by\\nan interpretation that relies on extraneous principles).  Here, I\\nthink we should apply a Christian parable, where a cold drink can\\nhave its value and a hot drink can have its value, but the\\nlukewarm we should spit out.

It allows your\\n electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who\\n sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except\\n the intended recipient.)\\n\\n RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.\\n Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,\\n which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.\\n\\n2)  How can I get RIPEM?\\n\\n RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is\\n considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution\\n to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or\\n Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README\\n file:\\n\\n #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution\\n #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,\\n #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.\\n\\n Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is\\n included with the distribution.  You should read it before using\\n RIPEM.\\n\\n The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will\\n reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the\\n humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the\\n friend.\\n\\n RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents\\n in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for\\n info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and\\n does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.\\n\\n RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \"home site\" on\\n rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the\\n U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out\\n how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file\\n GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are\\n available here in addition to the full source tree.\\n\\n3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?\\n\\n Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of\\n Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to\\n Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice\\n Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports\\n are expected, and help of users is invited.\\n\\n4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?\\n\\n Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend\\n on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users\\n guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM\\n with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.\\n Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU\\n Emacs.\\n\\n If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one\\n in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,\\n and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.\\n\\n5)  What is RSA?\\n\\n RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means\\n that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to\\n decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,\\n you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your\\n decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public\\n key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to\\n decrypt it.  (Note that the \"message\" sent with RSA is normally just\\n the DES key to the real message. (See \"What is DES?\")\\n\\n Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication,\\n the fingerprint of the message (See \"What is a fingerprint, like\\n MD5?\") is encrypted with the sender\\'s private key.  The recipient can\\n use the sender\\'s public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message\\n must have come from the sender.\\n\\n RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who\\n invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in\\n pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.\\n\\n6)  What is DES?\\n\\n DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or\\n secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to\\n encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.\\n\\n RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts\\n your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the\\n recipient\\'s public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,\\n allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.\\n\\n DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a\\n key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it\\n should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large\\n corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future\\n RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using\\n multiple encryption with DES.\\n\\n7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate?\\n\\n PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of\\n encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these\\n documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.\\n\\n RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM\\n specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not\\n handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.\\n\\n8)  What\\'s this about distributing and authenticating keys?\\n\\n For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know\\n your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message\\n received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important\\n that this information be accurate; if a \"bad guy\" convinces her that\\n his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.\\n\\n RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,\\n the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are\\n described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.\\n None of them provide perfect security.\\n\\n9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?\\n\\n RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various\\n characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in\\n your key may be the same as those of lots of other people\\'s keys.\\n This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the\\n same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the\\n same length, etc.\\n\\n10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\\n\\n MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.\\n It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,\\n of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not\\n possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a\\n different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,\\n instead of signing the entire message with the sender\\'s private key,\\n only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.\\n\\n MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often\\n used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a\\n passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.\\n\\n MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in\\n RFC 1321.\\n\\n11)  What is PGP?\\n\\n PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.\\n PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.\\n PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.\\n\\n Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM:\\n\\n - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without\\n   a direct network connection.\\n\\n - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of\\n   working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible\\n   with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with\\n   PGP 2.0.)\\n\\n - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security\\n   Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.\\n   PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus,\\n   PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims\\n   that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in\\n   the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP\\'s original\\n   author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:\\n\\n   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, \\n   #you shouldn\\'t actually run PGP on your computer, because Public\\n   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is\\n   #contraband.  \\n\\n - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside\\n   the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites\\n   in Europe and other places.\\n\\n Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is\\n recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.\\n\\n Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export\\n restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people think it\\n shouldn\\'t be that way, and some people interpret various documents\\n differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably\\n seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in\\n misc.legal.computing.  (See:  \"DISCLAIMER\")\\n\\n12)  What about RPEM?\\n\\n RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,\\n but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in\\n an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark\\n Riordan, the same author as RIPEM.\\n\\n Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many\\n (including Rabin), Public Key Partners (PKP) claimed that their patent\\n was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested\\n in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just RSA.\\n This claim is not universally accepted by any means, but was not\\n challenged for pragmatic reasons.\\n\\n RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.\\n\\n13)  What is MIME?\\n\\n MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is\\n described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup\\n comp.mail.mime.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely\\n clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type\\n application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I\\n hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on\\n the matter.\\n\\n14)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...',\n","  '\\n\\nAccording to what reasonable principle of justice does standing in intimate\\ngeographical and psychological relations to a league give one some privileged\\nright to play in it?',\n","  '\\nMy package is based on several articles about non-standard radiosity and\\nsome unpublished methods.\\n\\nThe main articles are:\\n\\n-  Cohen, Chen, Wallace, Greenberg : \\n    A Progressive Refinement Approach to fast Radiosity Image Generation\\n     Computer Graphics (SIGGRAPH), V. 22(No. 4), pp 75-84, August 1988\\n\\n-  Silion, Puech\\n    A General Two-Pass Method Integrating Specular and Diffuse Reflection\\n    Computer Graphics (SIGGRAPH), V23(No. 3), pp335-344, July 1989 \\n\\n\\nI do not use hemi-cubes.

That which is authoratative is authoratative,\\nand to say \"I question to word of this authority\" is ridiculous. If it is \\nopen to question, it isn\\'t an authority. On the other hand, it is perfectly\\nreasonable to question whether something is an authority. The catch phrase\\nhere should be \"authenticate authority.\" Once you have authenticated\\nyour authority, you must believe what it says, or you are not treating it as\\nan authority. \\n\\nThe difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy. You \\ncan perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistency\\nin what it teaches, or by showing that it does not obey its own rules of\\ndiscourse. But the fact that I cannot discredit something does not, in\\ninself, accredit it. (Nor does the fact that I can convince myself and \\nother that I have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false.)\\nI cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings, \\nbecause if I can independantly verify its teachings, I don\\'t need an \\nauthority. I need an authority only when there is information I need which\\nI cannot get for myself. Thus, if I am to authenticate an authority, I must\\ndo it by some means other than by examining its teachings. \\n\\nIn practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we don\\'t\\nhave time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves. Every scientist\\nworing today assumes, on the authority of the scintific community, all sorts\\nof knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to \\nverify for himself.\\n\\nIn spiritual matters, we accept authority because we have no direct source \\nofinformation. We select our authorities based on various criteria. (I am\\na Catholic, in part, because the historical claims of the RC church seem\\nthe strongest.) Without authorities there would be no subject matter for\\nbelief, unless we simply made something up for ourselves (as many do).\\n\\nThe atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities. This is a\\nreasonable assertion in itself, but it leads to a practical difficulty.\\nIf you reject all authority out of hand, you reject all possibility of\\nevery receiving information. Thus the atheist position can never possibly\\nchange. It is non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific. \\n\\nTo demand scintific or rational proof of God\\'s existence, is to deny\\nGod\\'s existence, since neither science, nor reason, can, in their very\\nnature, prove anything.\\n\\n\\n',\n","  \"\\nThis is a lovely area for anecdotes, but I am sure you are on to something.\\nAs a physician, I almost never get sick: usually, when something horrendous\\nis going around, I either don't get it at all or get a very mild case.\\nWhen I do get really sick, it is always something unusual.\\n\\nThis was not the situation when I was in medical school, particularly on\\npediatrics.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nJohn Bradley\\'s free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG,\\nGIF, and other image formats.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu\\nor ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called \\'xv-???.tar.Z\\' (where ??? is the\\nversion number, currently 2.21); it is located in the \\'contrib\\' directory on\\nexport or the \\'pub/xv\\' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits\\ninternally, which means it\\'s not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit\\ndisplay (you\\'ll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn\\'t use XV to\\nconvert full-color images to JPEG, because they\\'ll get color-quantized first.\\nBut XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.\\nCAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check\\nthe \"save at normal size\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will\\nbe blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\\n\\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\\nmode, not in a window.\\n\\nOS/2:\\n\\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip\\n    Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.

GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing\\n    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed\\n    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nI have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris,\\nbut surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.\\n\\nAcorn Archimedes:\\n\\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nThere\\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\\n\\n\\nPortable software for almost any system:\\n\\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\\'ll also need a viewer program.\\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\\n\\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else\\'s files.\\n\\n\\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\\n\\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don\\'t forget to\\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\\nIf you are on a PC and don\\'t know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\\n(If you don\\'t know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\\n\\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\\nprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have\\ntested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.\\n\\nWe have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.\\nCompanies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.\\nWe do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in\\nproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).\\nWe hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with\\nanything that\\'s free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you\\'d like to\\ncontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.\\n\\n\\n[7]  What\\'s all this hoopla about color quantization?\\n\\nMost people don\\'t have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.\\nTypical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display\\n256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n',\n","  \"\\n[...]\\n\\n(the date I have for this is 1-26-93)\\n\\nnote Clinton's statements about encryption in the 3rd paragraph..

We had a discussion\\nabout it a while ago. \\n\\n\\nThen OFM comments :\\n\\n\\nWith my appreciation to the moderator, I believe that further elaboration\\nis needed. This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue\\nof the Copt-Net Newsletter :\\n\\nUnder the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed\\nto the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played\\nleading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak\\nabout the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the\\nEcumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said\\nthat the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their\\ntime in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics\\nstarted to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor\\nMarcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St.\\nDioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference\\nwas clear: \"You have nothing to do with the Church.\"  These political motives\\nbecame even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was\\nunfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in\\nmonophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only\\none nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.\\n\\nThe Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was\\nportrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant\\nbelieving in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His\\ndivinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His\\nhumanity were united in one nature called \"the nature of the incarnate word\",\\nwhich was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two\\nnatures \"human\" and   \"divine\"  that are   united in   one \"without mingling,\\nwithout confusion, and without alteration\" (from the  declaration of faith at\\nthe end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures \"did not separate\\nfor a moment or the twinkling of an eye\" (also from  the declaration of faith\\nat the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).\\n\\nThe  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of\\nChalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they\\nwanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian,\\nindependent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very\\nstrict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the\\nWestern Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal\\nto be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn\\'t  quite go the\\nextra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic\\nChurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile \"semantic\" differences between\\nall  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th\\nsuccessor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  \"To the  Coptic Church, faith is\\nmore  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and\\nterminology are of  little importance to us.\"  Throughout this  century,  the\\nCoptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The\\nCoptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has\\nremained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a\\nmember  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East\\nCouncil of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the\\nChristian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the\\ntheological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and\\nEvangelical Churches.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nAs a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign\\na common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism\\nwas condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in\\nMonophysitism.\\n\\nPeace,\\n\\nNabil\\n\\n          .-------------------------------------------------------------.\\n         /  Nabil Ayoub                        ____/   __  /    ____/  /\\n        /  Engine Research Center             /       /   /    /      /\\n       /  Dept. of Mechanical Engineering    ___/    __  /    /      /\\n      /  University of Wisconsin-Madison    /       /   |    /      /\\n     /  Email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu  _____/ __/   _|  _____/  /\\n    \\'-------------------------------------------------------------\\'\\n\\n[As I mentioned in a brief apology, the comment quoted above from me\\nis confused.  I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As\\nAndrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were\\nactually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil\\nexplains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered\\nheretical probably aren\\'t.\\n\\nChalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and\\nAntiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable\\nto moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree\\nthat there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course\\nof the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got\\nrejected who didn\\'t intend heresy, but simply used language that was\\nnot understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have\\njointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are\\ngroups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This\\nposting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also\\na remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called\\nmonophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called\\nNestorians are not heretical either.

All they\\ncare about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not. That,\\nafter all IS the bottom line. \\n\\n\\tSecond, if I look at all the people I know who use any form\\nof encryption at all, and this group spans people from the morons who\\nstill insist that the DES is a good and secure standard, to people \\nlooking at trying to improve upon existing strategies, I can not think\\nof anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaves\\ntheir methods open to abuse. The Clipper does this, because people make\\nmistakes by nature, and the US government is made up of people who are\\njust as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else. \\n\\n\\tThird, since most of the people I know are at least marginaly\\nfamiliar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption\\nstratigies, I can't see how most of them are going to blindly trust that\\nsomeone will not figure out a good way to compromise the Clipper Chip.\\nThat despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it. So, I can \\nnot see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip.\\n\\n\\tFourth, when it comes to criminal abuse, sure there are many stupid\\npeople out there. And yes, some will be open to being caught via the \\nbuilt in back door of the Clipper Chip. However, anyone who is going to\\ndo any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is going\\nto run into that problem pretty damned fast and, I would assume, start\\nlooking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption. \\n\\n\\n\\tIf nothing else were avalible, none of this would be an issue. However,\\nthe truth is that most private encryption users that I've ever run into\\nsimply do not give a damn about the legal status of RSA or PGP or anything\\nelse. If it works, they use it. This is not going to change either. I do\\nnot think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be\\nslowed down by the advent of the Clipper Chip. It is all to easy to \\nconvert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is, if anything,\\nthe Clipper Chip just adds another tool to the user.\\n\\n\\n\\tThe bottom line here is that people will use what works, and\\nunavoidibly, I'm sure most criminals would rather face an encryption\\nrelated charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty\\ncharges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy.\\n\\tThe other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide \\nuseage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is\\nout of the bag (Or if you have an interest in snooping, Pandora's Box\\nhas been opened), and this is not going to change.

For\\nproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.\\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket\\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --\\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\\n\\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a\\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new\\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\\nfrom past masters.\\n\\n     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called\\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\\n\"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.\" \\nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you\\'ve made us mad!  What are these\\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\\n\\n     Well I\\'ll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\\n\"fact\" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\\nless than many billions of dollars.\\n\\n     It took some of the last generation\\'s experts to teach us\\nsome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun\\'s first rocket was not a\\nSaturn V.  General Schriever\\'s ICBM\\'s didn\\'t take ten years to\\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\\'t cost $1 billion.\\n\\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950\\'s to remind\\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\\'s. \\nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\\nlittle, Test a little.\\n\\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\\ndidn\\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\\'d just change\\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\\nALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\\nknown as \"Shape Shifter\" than \"Space Lifter.\"  We didn\\'t spend a\\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When\\'s the\\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\\'t\\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\\nthreat that he\\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\\nit ran over cost or schedule.\\n\\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn\\'t keep in mind its\\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But\\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\\nbudget.\\n\\n     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:\\n(See charts)\\n\\n     I\\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950\\'s\\nand 1960\\'s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\\ncan\\'t see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\\n\\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\\n\\n     I say to you -- we\\'ll see you at White Sands in June.  You\\nbring your view-graphs, and I\\'ll bring my rocketship.  If we do\\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.

Reproduced under open license granted by Audio\\nBooks, Inc.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER(R), 1629 K St. NW, Washington,\\nDC  20006.\\n\\n   Hello, my friends, this is Dr. Beter.  Today is April 30,\\n1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.\\n\\n  It\\'s now been almost one month since war broke out in the South\\nAtlantic.  On the surface it seems that it\\'s only a dispute\\nbetween Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-swept\\nFalkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it\\'s far\\nmore than that.\\n\\n   The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a\\ngiant military operation.  During this month of April 1982,\\nfierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the South\\nAtlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of the\\nhostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on\\nall sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in the\\nSouthern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.\\n\\n   Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade of\\nthe Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time a\\ncounterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.\\n\\n   To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of\\ntime, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter is\\ncoming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are\\noverextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty\\'s navy cannot\\nsimply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time\\nwithout drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the British\\nwill be forced to undertake military operations very soon no\\nmatter how risky they may be.\\n\\n   There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no\\nchoice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  That\\nreason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already suffered\\nlosses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there will\\nbe no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by\\nthe British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts\\nwill the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle\\nlosses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choice\\nbut to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking\\neven heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short,\\nmy friends, Her Majesty\\'s navy has sailed into a trap.\\n\\n   The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange,\\nironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we\\'ve been hearing\\ncountless commentators referring to the British task force as an\\n\"armada\" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be very\\nuneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400\\nyears ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force,\\nbut it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it\\nchanged the course of history--and it was none other than the\\nEnglish navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.\\n\\n   The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the\\nreign of England\\'s Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasion\\nfleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England. \\nThey were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drake\\nand his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada\\nby changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equipped\\nwith new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of\\nreach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shattered\\nthe big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barely\\nhalf the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake\\'s\\ndefeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It opened\\nthe door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its\\nexpansion into a truly global empire.\\n\\n   Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full\\ncircle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the\\nworld empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and now\\nthe cultures of England and of Spain are once again in\\nconfrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing for\\ninvasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Four\\nhundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day;\\ntoday, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.\\n\\n   The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake\\nPassage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat of\\nthe Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain\\'s\\nnaval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada may\\nwell break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal\\nNavy.\\n\\n   My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:\\n\\nTopic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND\\nTopic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE\\nTopic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.\\n\\nTopic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month\\nit looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century and\\na half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great\\nBritain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over the\\nFalklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have been\\ncountless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it\\ncalls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing\\nin the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about\\nthem.\\n\\n   The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba\\nis from the United States, and they are not much of a prize. \\nAfter 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer\\nthan 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, the\\nremote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over,\\nand yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We are\\nwatching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.\\n\\n   The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all\\nabout its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO\\'s\\ndoorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it\\'s\\ngot at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers,\\nsubmarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships have\\neven been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight. \\nWave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated\\nand sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships and\\nsubmarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and\\nsent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force has\\ngrown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada\\nnumbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has\\nalready been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.\\n\\n   Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What\\'s this\\nfight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in the\\nmajor media is \"oil.\"  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist\\nunder the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands,\\nbut that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does it\\nexplain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina\\nthis month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine\\nseizure of South Georgia Island.\\n\\n   South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with\\nno known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South\\nGeorgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South Georgia\\nIsland is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys,\\nglaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable. \\nOn top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or\\nhistorical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect it\\nstands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.\\n\\n   In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by\\nArgentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and took\\nover the Island.  For that and other historical reasons,\\nArgentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina,\\nnot Britain.\\n\\n   But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  It\\nhas always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or\\nSpain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even\\nmore unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina\\'s\\nleaders are military men and they think in military terms.  They\\nwere well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island\\ncould not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they were\\nsetting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island\\nwas retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina\\'s\\nmilitary junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia\\nIsland at all?\\n\\n   My friends, the answers to all these questions are military,\\nnot political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses an\\nenormous military secret.  It\\'s a giant underground installation\\nburied under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island. \\nThe real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret\\ninstallation, together with two other similar installations which\\nI will describe shortly.\\n\\n   The secret military complexes have been in existence for many\\nyears; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclear\\nwar timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in\\nWashington.  For the past two months I\\'ve been reporting the\\ndetails of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain\\nand verify them.\\n\\n   The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of\\nthis year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat\\nthat caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.\\n\\n   What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of\\nthe Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  The\\nmutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, the\\nRockefeller cartel--and Russia\\'s new rulers in the Kremlin are\\nbehind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 of\\nthe \"PROJECT Z\" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phase\\nis to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both\\nRussia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR\\nONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the\\nexistence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around\\nthe world.\\n\\n   The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are\\nworking with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of\\nother countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend to\\nride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in\\nGovernment war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally lie\\nsmoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered\\nremains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at the\\nsecret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the\\nopen.  They will confront the world with the only remaining\\nfresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using\\nthat military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of\\nthe world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to\\npave the way for world domination very soon by setting off\\nNUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller cartel\\nand Russia\\'s new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a\\nrace against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.\\n\\n   Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are\\nbenefitting from war preparations which were started by the\\nRockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years since\\nthe Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United\\nStates Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the United\\nStates Government has been a house divided, torn by internal\\npower struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions. \\nBut before that, the United States had been dominated for decades\\nboth economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller\\nBrothers.\\n\\n   In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world\\ndomination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half\\nsecret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28. \\nIt was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret\\nwhile appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all the\\ndetails, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  By\\ndeliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United\\nStates would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia. \\nThen the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be\\nunleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.\\n\\n   When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the\\nRockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the\\nlate 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early that\\nthe war being planned would have very different effects on the\\nNorthern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the United\\nStates and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern\\nHemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great\\nBritain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, the\\nstrategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are\\nrelatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expected\\nthat the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern\\nHemisphere war.\\n\\n   In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious\\nradioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas\\nnot initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far the\\nwar clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there is\\nvery little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern\\nHemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air from\\nthe North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then\\nit works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror image\\nof this process takes up the southern half of the planet. \\nNorthern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone,\\nbut very little of the air changes places.\\n\\n   The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming\\nnuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for\\ngenerations to come; but if the calculations are right, the\\nSouthern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war. \\nThis was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  A\\nquick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefeller\\ncartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As I\\ndiscussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson\\nRockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during\\nthe war.  He accomplished this as so-called \"Coordinator of\\nHemispheric Defense\" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. \\nSo that takes care of the South American continent and its\\nnatural resources.\\n\\n   Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefeller\\ncontrol was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa,\\nespecially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to the\\nefforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER\\nNo. 36.\\n\\n   Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land\\nmasses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and\\nNew Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the\\nRockefellers.\\n\\n   The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military\\ninstallations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming\\nwar.  By this means they expected to become the masters of the\\nsurviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern\\nHemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually\\nrecovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire\\nwould be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the third\\ngeneration Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to\\ninherit the Earth.\\n\\n   In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after\\nthe war, some means would have to be available to project\\nmilitary power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts against\\nRockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the\\nbeam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwar\\nmilitary domination of the world was found to be a navy.  A\\nminimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based\\nin the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since the\\nreserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the\\nNorthern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in\\nexisting shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be built\\nand they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is no\\nsmall task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it was\\nessential that the ships remain hidden after they were built. \\nThe best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and\\nnaval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, the\\nsecret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear\\nattack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered\\nprematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.\\n\\n   The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection\\nagainst attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all\\nthese plans were still in the early stages of development, the\\nanswer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip to\\nSweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden\\nnaval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs\\nwhich come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port is\\na gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off\\nwith enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the water\\na huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.\\n\\n   The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided\\nthat a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the\\nSwedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey of\\ncandidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey covered\\ncoastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areas\\nwere rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong. \\nOther areas were rejected because they were too close to the\\nequator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too\\nmany people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy\\nimpossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for\\nthe secret naval installations be totally secure politically.\\n\\n   At last the sites for the secret naval installations were\\nselected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was\\nselected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71\\nthree months ago when I called attention to New Zealand\\'s extreme\\nimportance in the coming war.\\n\\n   In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand\\nnaval installation had to be divided up into two sites located\\nclose together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South\\nIsland where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes\\ndown virtually to the water\\'s edge.  The other part of the\\ninstallation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island,\\nwhich is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Island\\nfacility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.\\n\\n   The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever since\\nWorld War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even\\ncloser to the United States than to Great Britain.  The location\\nis far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep\\nunder mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are also\\ntoo deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the New\\nZealand site is well situated to command the entire South\\nPacific.\\n\\n   In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found. \\nThat site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is located\\nperfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  The\\ntall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret\\ninstallation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island. \\nIt is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that of\\nNew Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Island\\nwas virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the\\nnortheast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away from\\nthe secret new installation which was being built, but Britain\\ntook no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down. \\nSince that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia\\nIsland except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.\\n\\n   Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in New\\nZealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960\\'s. \\nThe techniques were adapted from those used previously to build\\nother large underground facilities, such as the NORAD\\ninstallation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however these\\ntechniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve\\nconstruction access directly from the sea instead of overland. \\nIn this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in\\nappearance both during and after construction.\\n\\n   The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let\\nships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well\\ncamouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the\\nentrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  When\\nsealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you\\nknow exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction\\nprojects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying\\naround to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which house\\nthe secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and\\ndebris was disposed of at sea.\\n\\n   Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be\\noutfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fake\\ndisarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed\\ngreatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal\\nrole in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretary\\nof Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60\\'s McNamara\\npresided over the public paring back of America\\'s visible\\nmilitary power.  This included the closing down and dismantling\\nof entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all that\\nshipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends,\\nwas to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in\\nNew Zealand and South Georgia Island!\\n\\n   The secret naval installations have been used as duplication\\nfacilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and\\nbuilt here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary Caspar\\nWeinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build two\\nships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship is\\nan exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more true\\nin recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing\\ntechniques.\\n\\n   The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret\\ninstallations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of\\ncertain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclear\\npowered--nuclear \"subs\"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers;\\nand yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twin\\nwas built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and\\nfor the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have been\\nfinanced through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we\\nconstantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all three\\ncarriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft\\nwhose manufacture was financed the same way!\\n\\n   The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are\\nall duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, the\\nsecret naval ships possess one key difference.\\n\\n   Last month I revealed that the so-called \"Stealth Program\" has\\nsucceeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility\\nshield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distance\\nby distorting light waves in its vicinity.\\n\\n   A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into\\ncrash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of\\nthe secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been\\noutfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealth\\nprinciple is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes\\nbecause there is more room for the powerful equipment that\\ngenerates the field.\\n\\n   After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the American\\nBolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on\\nearth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of world\\ndomination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my\\nfriends, but three years ago they lost control of the United\\nStates Military.  Now it\\'s the American Bolsheviks who are in\\ncontrol, and they are bent on war.\\n\\n   These secret naval installations have precipitated what is\\nbeing called the \"Falklands crisis.\"\\n\\nTopic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described\\n\"PROJECT Z\", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR\\nWAR ONE.\\n\\n   An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here\\nare flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in\\nWashington.  It\\'s a plan by which the United States will strike\\nthe first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war\\nwith Russia.\\n\\n   Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and in\\ncertain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable\\nwar bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in\\nstalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United\\nStates and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grand\\nstrategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially\\ntheir secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer and\\nrule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know it\\nwill be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks\\nthemselves, this outcome will constitute victory.\\n\\n   Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two\\nmonths ago is still on track.  They are still shooting for\\nnuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time is\\nfast running out.\\n\\n   The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward\\nwar; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in\\nthis race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom are\\nequally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of the\\nBolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the\\nnew anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these two\\nmutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in\\ncertain ways.\\n\\n   In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that a\\nlimited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between\\nthe Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meeting\\nbetween Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turning\\npoint in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality,\\nand is responsible for the so-called \"Falkland crisis\" now\\ndominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this new\\nrelationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far\\nshort of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to be\\nsettled between them, but for the time being they have called a\\ntruce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly\\nenemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.\\n\\n   The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to\\nslow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war. \\nIf they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefeller\\ncartel in certain political movements which I discussed last\\nsummer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear war\\ntimetable will also give more breathing space for additional\\nanti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.\\n\\n   The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February\\nthat military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very\\nquickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effect\\nfast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.\\n\\n   The exact details of the \"PROJECT Z\" war plan are not known to\\neither the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlines\\nare known to be as I described last month.\\n\\n   It was decided that military action should be devised that\\nwould undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, the\\nBolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the\\nSouthern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By working\\ntogether, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to\\ndevise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone. \\nThe Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these\\nbases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to\\nattack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machine\\nprovided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.\\n\\n   It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both\\nsecret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be\\nattacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave the\\nBolshevik war plan still workable.\\n\\n   Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault\\non the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There was\\nno combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force\\nwhich could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside\\nworld.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the\\nvery war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.\\n\\n   But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different\\nmatter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was\\nalso its Achilles\\' heel.  The extreme isolation which protected\\nthe secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military\\nassault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and her\\nlong-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.\\n\\n   As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel has\\ndominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operatives\\nwere sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government\\nmilitary junta there.  The historic dispute over the Falkland\\nIslands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to\\nenable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentine\\ngenerals were not told everything about the situation by any\\nmeans, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to\\ndo.\\n\\n   As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders were\\npromised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after the\\nshooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine\\nhands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert military\\nassistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster the\\ntroubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefeller\\ncartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  With\\nthese combined promises of military glory and financial rewards,\\nthe Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.\\n\\n   On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attack\\nplan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things,\\nlanded at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia\\nIsland.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old\\nbuildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it they\\nalso raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British,\\nalways nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted as\\nexpected.  The British Antarctic survey ship \"Endurance\" put 22\\nMarines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down\\nthe Argentine flag.\\n\\n   The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine\\nJunta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a\\nboil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed that\\nSouth Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered\\nthat way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it now\\ncame in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this from\\nArgentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.\\n\\n   During late March, Argentine military forces started\\nassembling for an assault on the Falklands.  \"Nothing new\",\\nthought the British high command.  Argentina has carried out\\nthreatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believed\\nthat they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentine\\nforces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, this\\ntime they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentine\\npublic statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims\\nto the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next\\nday a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia\\nIsland.  The force was so small that it gave the appearance\\ninitially that it was just a side show from Argentina\\'s point of\\nview; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were\\noverpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13\\nalleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the joint\\nRockefeller-Russian attack plan.\\n\\n   Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine\\nforces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected. \\nBased on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, the\\nteam moved to a location on the mountain directly above the\\ncavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment was\\nset up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian\\nmembers concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening,\\nApril 3, the military high command in London finally learned what\\nwas really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was under\\nattack by virtually the only means possible.  The joint\\nRockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the\\nmountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only a\\nmatter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling\\nof the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the next\\nstep was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a\\nweapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that it\\nwould be a nerve gas.\\n\\n   The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the\\nBritish government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be\\ndescribed, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like the\\nso-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevik\\ncontrolled.  That\\'s why Margaret Thatcher always says, \"Me, too\"\\nany time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against\\nRussia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war\\nplan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective\\ncountries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered\\nthat their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.\\n\\n   Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval\\narmada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order of\\nthe day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding\\naround the clock.  The best estimates were that the drilling\\nwould break through into the roof of the naval base in about\\nthree weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach South\\nGeorgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  The\\nforces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend\\nthemselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval ships\\nwere ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle to\\nsail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with\\ntactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrance\\ndoors would be suicide.\\n\\n   On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island was\\nseized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports. \\nThe same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  He\\nwas forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the\\nRockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack\\npreparations.\\n\\n   That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the other\\nsecret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina. \\nThe two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on \"Red\\nAlert.\"  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin\\nbase were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already at\\nsea undergoing \"sea trials\", but that still left seven (7) major\\nships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the\\nnuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.\\n\\n   On that busy day of April 5, Argentina\\'s Foreign Minister,\\nCosta Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He was\\nalarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy. \\nCosta Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from\\ncertain officials.  He got them!\\n\\n   For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories\\nabout the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while\\nnegotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story. \\nThe Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as\\npossible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrived\\nin time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  The\\nofficial stories about \"slow movement\" of the British armada were\\nintended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be,\\nthe fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island,\\nthen it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the\\nannounced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of South\\nGeorgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.\\n\\n   It was initially expected that advance elements of the British\\nfleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two\\nweeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the joint\\nRockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it\\nwas completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a\\nshambles of the plan.\\n\\n   Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent\\nleft Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it was\\nannounced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran into\\ntrouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on\\na single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on\\nSouth Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and\\ncombat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  In\\nmoments the ship was without any command, its communications and\\nradar silenced.  Then a Russian \"sub\" closed in and quickly\\nfinished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It broke\\napart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as is\\nknown, there were no survivors.\\n\\n   This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two\\nresults, both important:\\n\\nFirst, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic\\nby the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into a\\nconfiguration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost\\nvaluable time.  Public announcements from London about the\\nprogress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable for\\narrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching\\nout longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the joint\\ncommando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.\\n\\nThe other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word was\\nflashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible\\naction.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting\\ninvolved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could\\nbe in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, the\\nseven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in\\nsouthern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operational\\nheadquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast\\nof New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to\\nprovide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossible\\nto communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as I\\nexplained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, the\\nStealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded\\ncommunication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodes\\nheadquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the South\\nGeorgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of\\nSouth America.  The deployment of the available ships of the\\nSouth Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint\\nRockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had been\\nflushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in\\nNew Zealand!\\n\\n   The British ship\\'s sinking of April 14 was also followed by\\nother events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out\\nof port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos\\nAires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he\\nwas there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the top\\nGovernmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I have\\nrevealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines did\\nnot get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Four\\ndays later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boarded\\nhis plane, Haig somberly told reporters, \"Time is running out.\" \\nAnd so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.\\n\\n   The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into the\\nhollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik military\\nanalysts in London had not expected that it could be completed\\nuntil at least the following weekend.  The British fleet was\\nstill out of range.\\n\\n   The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the\\nlong hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it was\\ndetonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the\\neffects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killed\\neveryone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of the\\nbomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside\\nsufficiently to badly disable them.\\n\\n   Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging\\non the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands\\nawaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible to\\nthe eye due to their protective shields, which also protect\\nagainst beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the\\ntactics which the Russians employed.\\n\\n   Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships\\nusing their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF. \\nAs I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which\\nPRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations\\nof the ships to the attack submarines.  The \"subs\" were armed\\nwith special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to\\nexplode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have been\\nthrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective\\nshield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right\\nthrough each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode. \\nWithin 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven Bolshevik\\nStealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went\\ntheir Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from\\naround the world.\\n\\n   The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local\\ntime.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23. \\nThat evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public\\nwith the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym was\\nwearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught\\nalways to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinning\\nfrom ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian\\nmilitary operation had been a brilliant success.  The secret\\nBolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out,\\nbottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacific\\nfleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  By\\nworking together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won\\nthe secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.\\n\\nTopic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impression\\nthat war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the real\\nwar in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we are\\nwatching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  That\\naftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have been\\npromised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.\\n\\n   At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing\\nfor a public announcement that the United States will side with\\nBritain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heat\\nup fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but to\\nfight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot be\\nexplained without a public battle; but by fighting, the\\nBolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and\\ntragic defeat for the Royal Navy.\\n\\n   Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are now\\nconcentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  On\\nall sides now we are hearing about the so-called \"nuclear freeze\\nmovement.\"  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of all\\nkinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recent\\nmonths, there have even been referenda popping up on election\\nballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors are\\nbanding together to warn the public about what would happen if\\nthere were a nuclear war.\\n\\n   We are being told that all this is just popping up\\nspontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and\\nnothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet\\nnow we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have\\nspontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If you\\nbelieve that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never,\\nand I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and\\nmoney--and plenty of it.\\n\\n   What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations\\nmachine at work.  As I\\'ve explained in the past, the Rockefeller\\ncartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If it\\ndoes, they will lose everything because they are not in a\\nposition to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of the\\nRockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there is\\na war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in\\nits power to prevent a nuclear war.\\n\\n   The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller\\ncartel creates certain temporary common interests between them\\nand Russia; but as Russia\\'s new rulers know very well, this does\\nnot spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the\\nRockefeller group.  It\\'s purely a matter of practical necessity\\nright now for the Rockefellers.\\n\\n   The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, and\\nthey are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with\\nthe Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world of\\nthe deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear\\nwar; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of\\nreckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.\\n\\n   The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective\\nwith their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective is\\nrenewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old\\ndream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly\\nprovided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar\\ncampaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called Reagan\\nAdministration has become so hawkish that it\\'s scaring people. \\nThe Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on\\nthat latent fear as a tool of power.\\n\\n   These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklands\\ncrisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefeller\\npropaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that\\nsurrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A new\\nsuper-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the\\nbill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the new\\norganization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The working\\nname, though this may be changed, is the \"World Nonproliferation\\nCouncil.\"  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of\\nnuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be\\nto use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.\\n\\n                       LAST MINUTE SUMMARY\\n\\n   Now it\\'s time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIO\\nLETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-called\\nFalkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secret\\nBolshevik-controlled naval installations in the Southern\\nHemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of the\\nRockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down\\nthe nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but the\\nresults remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the Royal\\nNavy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain\\'s Waterloo at sea\\nmay well be at hand.\\n\\n   My friends, two factions are struggling for control over our\\nUnited States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  They\\ndiffer in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If we\\nare ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the\\npower of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.

However, just in case\\nsomething went wrong, I\\'m going to describe some of the changes needed\\nto get Windows 3.1 working with the 1542.  Also, you may have noticed\\nthat installing Windows 3.1 makes your PC run much slower, even when\\nyou\\'re not running Windows; methods of speeding it up are discussed in\\nthe section called, \"Windows 3.1 runs slowly\".\\n\\n\\n* MSDOS configuration:\\n\\n     The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your\\nCONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  If you follow the instructions,\\nyou\\'ll notice that you\\'ll need to use double-buffering with SmartDrive\\n(this is the default setup).  You\\'ll also notice that your system runs\\nmuch, much slower -- in both Windows *AND* MSDOS.  See the section\\ncalled, \"Windows 3.1 runs slowly\", for some ways of speeding your system\\nup.\\n\\n\\n* Windows configuration:\\n\\n     To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows, make sure that the\\n\"[388Enh]\" section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the entry:\\n\\n\\tVirtualHDIRQ=Off\\n\\nI believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry\\nto SYSTEM.INI, but I\\'m not sure.  If this doesn\\'t work for you, you\\nmight want to try adding some more lines:\\n\\n\\tVirtualHDIRQ=Off\\n\\tSystemROMBreakPoint=false\\n\\tEMMExclude=A000-CFFF\\n\\n(You probably don\\'t need the above lines, though.)  The\\n\"SystemROMBreakPoint\" entry is used to enable support for memory\\nmanagers like QEMM/386MAX (only needed if you use such programs).\\n\\n\\n* Windows 3.1 runs slowly:\\n\\n     Once you do get Windows 3.1 running with the 1542, chances are that\\nyour system is running much slower than before.  If it\\'s not, it\\'s\\nprobably because:\\n\\n     1. You happen to be using ASPI4DOS.SYS version 3.1 in your\\n\\tCONFIG.SYS file.  Congratulations -- this appears to be a\\n\\twinning solution.\\n\\n     2. You are very lucky.  Whether your luck will hold out remains to\\n\\tbe seen ....\\n\\nIf your system is running much slower than before, this is almost\\ndefinitely caused by Smartdrive with double-buffering.  According to the\\nWindows documentation, and the Microsoft technical note #Q81808\\n(\"SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS.SYS\"), you must use\\nSmartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  While this works, it really\\nslows down your PC; I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a\\nfactor of 5 (FIVE).  As I consider this unacceptable, I looked for other\\nsolutions.\\n\\n     Unfortunately, you cannot just disable double-buffering.  If you\\ndo, Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work, and you might even\\ndestroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3.1.\\nWhat you can do is one of the following:\\n\\n     1. Use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  It is my\\n\\topinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused\\n\\teither by horribly inefficient double-buffering, or by a bug in\\n\\tSmartdrive.\\n\\n     2. Use a driver that provides \"VDS\" services (\"VDS\" stands for\\n\\t\"Virtual DMA Services\").  This is a standard, which is supported\\n\\tby Windows 3.1, that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like\\n\\tthe 1542) to work with Windows.\\n\\n     After trashing my hard disk countless times, I found the following\\nsolutions, none of which require using Smartdrive (note, however, that I\\nam now getting occasional parity errors, which are probably *NOT* caused\\nby these solutions, but might be -- see below).  While the following\\ndoes not require Smartdrive, using some kind of disk cache utility is\\nstrongly recommended, as this makes Windows run much, much faster:\\n\\n1. If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, or you do not need ASPI\\n   functions (for controlling a CDROM, tape drive, more than two\\n   physical hard disks, etc.), you can add the SCSIHA.SYS driver to your\\n   CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:\\n\\n\\tDRIVER=c:\\\\SCSIHA.SYS /V386\\n\\n   (Windows needs the \"/V386\" option.)  This driver MUST be loaded into\\n   LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory), and it occupies\\n   about 16-20K.  As of November 1992, the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be\\n   obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully, it\\'s\\n   still there).\\n\\n2. If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, version\\n   3.0 or 3.0a, you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers\\n   in your CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:\\n\\n\\tDRIVER=c:\\\\ASPI4DOS.SYS\\n\\tDRIVER=c:\\\\SCSIHA.SYS /V386\\n\\n   Amazingly enough, the SCSIHA.SYS driver can also be loaded high\\n   (assuming you have DOS 5.0); I would have thought that this would\\n   crash my system, but it doesn\\'t.  I asked Adaptec\\'s technical support\\n   about this, and they said that loading SCSIHA.SYS high should be fine\\n   as long as ASPI4DOS.SYS is loaded LOW.\\n\\n   On my system, NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would\\n   occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting\\n   Windows, with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my\\n   C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\*.GRP files would be corrupted).  For me, these crashes\\n   usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE\\n   the default Windows shell, and vice-versa.  This is the reason\\n   SCSIHA.SYS may be necessary.\\n\\n   I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA.SYS is necessary with versions of\\n   ASPI4DOS earlier than 3.0.\\n\\n   Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a without\\n   SCSIHA.SYS; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  I consider\\n   these people lucky.  Others, like me, have had all sorts of problems.\\n\\n3. In my opinion, the best, but not necessarily the easiest, solution is\\n   to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1.  The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer\\n   needed.  Unfortunately, while you could get previous ASPI4DOS\\n   upgrades from the Adaptec BBS, the ASPI4DOS 3.1 driver is not\\n   available from the Adaptec BBS.  As far as I know, there are only\\n   three ways to get a copy:\\n\\n      * You can buy the new (as of November 1992) Adaptec EZ SCSI driver\\n\\tkit, which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3.1 as well as other\\n\\tdrivers, such as CDROM drivers.  I believe the list price is\\n\\taround $75.\\n\\n      * If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS, you\\n\\tcan supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for\\n\\taround $30.\\n\\n      * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0\\n\\tfor MSDOS.  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in\\n\\tdifferent directories.  Note further that only ASPI4DOS is\\n\\tincluded; the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two\\n\\thard disks are not included.  This is where I obtained my copy\\n\\tof ASPI4DOS 3.1.\\n\\nNote, however, that I am now getting occasional parity errors with\\nWindows.  In all probability, defective hardware in my PC is causing\\nthis, as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above\\nsolutions.  However, because these parity errors occur only during disk\\naccesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that the\\nparity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/off\\ntiming for certain disk transfers might cause this).  I\\'ve run various\\nmemory tests for hours at a time, and these tests have found no\\nproblems.  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal\\ntiming requirements, which cause parity errors during disk transfers\\n(this is why the memory tests didn\\'t find any problems -- the problems\\nshow up only under disk I/O).  However, I\\'m mentioning this just in case\\nit isn\\'t a hardware problem.\\n\\n\\n***** Floppy-controller-based tape backup devices:\\n\\n     There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a\\nfloppy-controller-based tape backup device, such as the Colorado Memory\\nSystems Jumbo 250:\\n\\n1. Tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  The tape drive\\n   constantly starts, stops, starts, stops, etc.\\n\\n2. Tape operations may be erratic, or encounter too many tape errors.\\n   (This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542.\\n   However, I\\'ve heard of other people having similar problems, and so\\n   I\\'m mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my\\n   1542.)\\n\\n\\n* Tape backups/restores take a long time:\\n\\n     If you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, you may\\nhave to adjust the Adaptec 1540/1542 \"bus on/off timing\" for best\\nresults when using the tape drive.  Normally, while doing a tape backup\\nor restore, the tape drive motor should be continuously running, with\\nonly an occasional pause.  However, the default bus timing on the\\nAdaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop,\\nstart and stop, every few seconds.  This causes needless wear to the\\ntape and tape drive (however, note that a dirty tape head or a defective\\ntape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean).\\nThis also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longer\\nthan necessary.\\n\\n     The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to\\ntransfer data in memory to/from the tape drive, and the Adaptec uses DMA\\nto transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  The floppy DMA needs\\nto feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is\\nnot fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA, the tape drive stops,\\nrewinds a bit, and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it).\\nThe default bus timing on the Adaptec (which is really DMA timing) is\\n\"too large\".  For example, when a backup is done, data has to be\\ntransferred from a hard disk to memory, and then from memory to the\\ntape.  Because the default timing on the Adaptec \"hogs\" the memory too\\nmuch (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to\\nmemory), not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the\\ntape drive.  As a result, the tape drive constantly starts and stops,\\nbecause data is not fed to it quickly enough.\\n\\n     The solution is to change the Adaptec\\'s bus on/off timing.  The\\ndefault factory setting is 11 microseconds on, and 5 microseconds off.\\nThe \"bus on\" timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  This can\\nbe done in one of two ways:\\n\\n* If you have ASPI4DOS, you can use the \"/n\" option.  For example, I use\\n  a \"bus on\" timing of 4 microseconds, which means that I use the\\n  following line in my CONFIG.SYS file:\\n\\n\\tDEVICE=c:\\\\aspi4dos.sys /n4\\n\\n  Note that there is NO space between the \"/n\" and the \"4\".\\n\\n* If you don\\'t have ASPI4DOS, your only recourse is to try to find a\\n  program called \"SETSCSI.EXE\", which is very difficult to find.  The\\n  reason is that Adaptec, for reasons of their own, does not seem to\\n  want this widely distributed.  I once asked someone who worked for\\n  Adaptec, and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  If you have\\n  anonymous ftp access to the Internet, you could try using archie to\\n  hunt down a copy; I believe that there are a couple of sites that have\\n  it.  If you do find a copy, you run it like so:\\n\\n\\tsetscsi -n:4\\n\\n  This adjusts the \"bus on\" timing to 4 microseconds.  Running\\n  SETSCSI.EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the\\n  factory defaults.\\n\\n  Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI.EXE if you use\\n  ASPI4DOS; SETSCSI.EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded.  I\\n  could use SETSCSI.EXE with SCSIHA.SYS, however.\\n\\nDo not lower the \"bus on\" timing below 2 microseconds, or increase it\\nabove 11 microseconds.  If you lower it too low, the hard disk\\nthroughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  For me, 4\\nmicroseconds works fine.  This value may work fine for you, or you may\\nhave to adjust it downwards a little.\\n\\n     Once you\\'ve lowered the \"bus on\" timing, tape backups and restores\\nshould run faster.\\n\\n     Also, do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other\\noptions that I have intentionally not described), unless you know what\\nyou are doing.  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse, by\\nstarving memory refresh.\\n\\n     A program called BUSTIFIX.EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS.  Unless\\nthis has been upgraded since I last checked (which has been a while),\\nthis is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple\\nof other files.  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the\\nbus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  However, when I tried\\nrunning this program with my 1542A, my system crashed.  At the time, I\\nwas running SCSIHA.SYS, and I didn\\'t check to see if there was a\\nconflict with it.  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B,\\nalthough the docs say that it works with the 1542A?\\n\\n\\n* Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors:\\n\\n     This \"problem\" may or may not exist.  Although it existed on my\\nsystem, a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it.\\nHowever, I\\'ve heard of other people having similar problems, and so I\\'m\\nmentioning this just in case it isn\\'t a hardware problem just on my\\n1542.\\n\\n     Symptoms of this \"problem\", which persists even after cleaning the\\ntape head:\\n\\n1. Backing up to tape encounters \"unusable sector detected\" errors,\\n   resulting in an aborted tape backup.\\n\\n2. Tape backup works, but the tape compare fails.\\n\\n3. The tape drive starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. much too often.\\n   Unlike the above-mentioned problem (\"Tape backups/restores take a\\n   long time\"), where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds,\\n   this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so.\\n\\n4. Fastback Plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  Other\\n   programs, like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software\\n   (assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the\\n   tape drive, but Fastback Plus 3.1 cannot.\\n\\n5. Too many tape read errors.\\n\\n     Although I do not know what is causing this problem, I discovered\\nthat using a different floppy controller solves it.  A few months ago, I\\nupgraded my motherboard, which contained an integrated floppy\\ncontroller.  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542, I\\ninitially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  After a while, I\\ndecided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on\\nthe motherboard.  When I did this, the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250)\\nreliability increased dramatically, and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenly\\nable to find and use the tape drive.\\n\\n     I don\\'t know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542.\\nOn the one hand, the floppy drives worked great when they were attached\\nto the 1542, which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the\\n1542.  On the other hand, the tape drive didn\\'t work well attached to\\nthe 1542 floppy controller, but it did work when attached to a different\\ncontroller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my\\n1542.  I did change floppy drive cables, and so it is conceivable that\\nthe problem was in the cables.  I don\\'t know what the cause really is;\\nhowever, if you\\'re having similar problems, you might want to consider\\ntrying a new floppy controller.\\n\\n\\n***** Sound cards:\\n\\n     Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound, and\\nthis is typically done using DMA.  Like the tape drive DMA, the\\nAdaptec\\'s DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA.  Unlike that of the\\ntape DMA, this \"conflict\" usually manifests itself as a parity error\\n(your system crashes with a parity error message).  What happens is\\nthat, data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the\\nAdaptec, memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough, which causes a\\nparity error.  Usually, getting a parity error means that there is a\\nhardware problem with your system; in this case, however, the parity\\nerror is not a symptom of bad hardware.\\n\\n     I\\'ve found that such parity errors typically occur while recording\\ndigitized sound, and the chances of such errors increase as you increase\\nthe recording fidelity (e.g., higher sampling rate, recording in stereo,\\nrecording using 16-bits instead of 8, etc.).\\n\\n     Like the tape drive solution, the solution here is to lower the\\nAdaptec\\'s \"bus on\" timing.  See the section on tape drives for\\ninformation on how this is done.  Note, however, that this may or may\\nnot solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity\\nerror.  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect\\nthis problem (i.e., some software is inefficient).  Disk caches, the\\nspeed of your hard disk, and the amount of disk fragmentation can also\\naffect this.\\n\\n\\n***** Miscellaneous info:\\n\\n     This section contains miscellaneous hints, tips, and rumors.  Much\\nof it is merely information that I\\'ve heard or read about, and have not\\nverified.  I believe that the following information is correct, but I\\'m\\nnot sure.  Use it at your own risk.\\n\\n* With QEMM 6.00, 6.01, and 6.02, you need to specify the \"DB=\"\\n  parameter (e.g., \"DB=2\"), unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver.\\n  If you don\\'t, QEMM will crash/hang at bootup.  Although the QEMM\\n  manual mentions this, the install program does not seem to detect that\\n  a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM\\n  command line (at least, this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install\\n  program -- I haven\\'t tested any other version).  Earlier versions of\\n  QEMM probably need this parameter, but I\\'m not sure (I\\'ve never used a\\n  version earlier than 6.00).\\n\\n  If you use ASPI4DOS, you do not need to give QEMM the \"DB=\" parameter.\\n\\n* Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one\\n  gigabyte in size.  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB, you\\n  need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec.  I\\'m not sure if this is\\n  still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec.\\n\\n* To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542, you need a SCSI CDROM drive and\\n  some drivers.  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces\\n  (non-SCSI); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  You have three\\n  choices for CDROM drivers (I have no idea how well the following\\n  solutions work, or even if they work -- the following is secondhand\\n  information):\\n\\n     1. You can buy Adaptec\\'s EZ SCSI driver package, which lists for\\n\\tsomething like $75.  If you already have older Adaptec drivers,\\n\\tyou can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around $30.  Contact\\n\\tAdaptec for details.  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains\\n\\teverything that you need.\\n\\n     2. You can buy the CorelSCSI! driver package, which is made by the\\n\\tsame people that make CorelDRAW!  This package contains CDROM\\n\\tdrivers, SCSI tape drivers, WORM drivers, etc.  I do not know\\n\\tthe list price, but I\\'ve seen this package sold for around\\n\\t$80-$90.  Note that CorelSCSI! does not come with the ASPI4DOS\\n\\tdriver, which is needed.  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS,\\n\\tyou may be better off getting Adaptec\\'s EZ SCSI instead.\\n\\n     3. [This method is obsolete, as the following drivers have been\\n\\tobsoleted by Adaptec\\'s EZ SCSI kit, but I\\'m mentioning it in\\n\\tcase someone already has these drivers.]  You can use the\\n\\tdrivers in the Adaptec ASW-1410 kit (ASPI4DOS) and the ASW-410\\n\\tkit (ASPI CDROM drivers).  You will have to get a copy of\\n\\tMSCDEX.EXE (a high-level CDROM driver), if it is not included in\\n\\tthe ASW-410 kit, but this is available from several bulletin\\n\\tboards.\\n\\n* To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542, you need software that knows\\n  how to talk to a SCSI tape drive.  Software that I\\'ve heard about are\\n  (again, like the above section on CDROM drives, I have no idea how\\n  well the following solutions work, or even if they work -- the\\n  following is secondhand information):\\n\\n     1. Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large\\n\\tnumber of SCSI tape drives.  It comes with SCSI drivers\\n\\t(ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup.\\n\\n     2. The CorelSCSI! driver package contains a SCSI tape backup\\n\\tprogram (see the above section on CDROM drives for more\\n\\tdetails).  However, note that CorelSCSI! does not come with, but\\n\\trequires, ASPI4DOS.\\n\\n* I\\'ve seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations:\\n\\n     1. 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS.\\n     2. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers.\\n     3. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS, Adaptec ASPI drivers, and\\n\\tCorelSCSI! drivers/programs.\\n\\n  I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration:\\n\\n     4. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers (including ASPI\\n\\tdrivers).\\n\\n* Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar\\n  for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver (you\\n  need this driver before you can use this program).  I\\'ve never used\\n  this version of GNU tar, but I\\'ve heard that it works (I don\\'t know\\n  how well, though).

The course will focus on remote\\nsensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1\\ndata.\\n\\nThe ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991\\nwith the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar\\ninstrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing\\nmissions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year\\n2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the\\npotential of experts using the practical applications of radar\\nremote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy\\nand the environment, with particular emphasis on applications\\nto geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near-\\ncoastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.\\n\\nThe education and practical training programme was\\ndeveloped jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The\\nfacilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and\\ninformation documents for the training course, will be\\nprovided by the Agency. Lecturers at the training course will\\ninclude high-level experts from other European and African\\norganisations active in remote sensing applications. Funds for\\nthe training course are being provided by the United Nations\\n\\n\\n\\nTrust Fund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy; the\\nprimary contributor to that Fund is the Government of Italy.\",\n","  '\\nAnd we all hope, Teddy, that you will graduate from the first grade\\nwhile Clinton is President.

What\\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\\nreality better than the alternatives.

And it\\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\\n\\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\\ncomputations, get done.

The generate\\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\\n\\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur's irrational motivation had\\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\\n\\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\\nthink supports their position (creationists).\",\n","  'I have the following 45 rpm singles for sale.

What is XFree86?\\n\\n   XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with\\n   X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and\\n   other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:\\n\\n    1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,\\n       selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require\\n       an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of\\n       1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by\\n       default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield\\n       up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.\\n    2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default\\n       operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now\\n       equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately\\n       20% faster than X386 1.2.\\n    3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,\\n       or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4\\n       with the \\'Advanced Compatibility Package\\', local connections from\\n       SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.\\n    4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.\\n       Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about\\n       the ATI and Trident drivers.\\n    5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt\\'s\\n       code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).\\n    6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is\\n       compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the\\n       contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.\\n    7) New configuration method which allows the server\\'s drivers and font\\n       renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary\\n       distributions.\\n    8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.\\n    9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA\\n       cards is now included.\\n\\n   The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2\\n   (they were not in XFree86 1.1):\\n\\n    1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of\\n       available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200 \\n       (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).\\n    2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the\\n       monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a \"two\\n       headed\" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only\\n       been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).\\n    3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.\\n    4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to\\n       consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for\\n       more information.)\\n    5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some \\n       versions of these devices were not previously compatible).\\n    6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor\\n       timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous\\n       documentation and a lot of experimentation).\\n    7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including\\n       implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many \\n       vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more \\n       information).\\n    8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has\\n       been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of\\n       0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks\\n       line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.\\n    9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig\\n       configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative\\n       and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new\\n       options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1) \\n       manual page for more information on the format of this file).\\n\\n       Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file\\n       in the source distribution for full details.\\n\\n   Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the\\n   current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.\\n\\n4. What OSs are supported?\\n\\n    XFree86 supports:\\n\\tSVR4.2: Consensys V4.2\\n\\tSVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC\\n\\tSVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2\\n\\tLinux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1\\n\\n\\tBSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active\\n\\tBSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.\\n\\n\\tNote that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,\\n\\tbut anyone should feel free to submit patches.\\n\\tIf you are interested in tackling this, send mail to\\n\\txfree86@physics.su.oz.au\\n\\n5. What video hardware is supported?\\n\\n   At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:\\n\\n\\tTseng ET4000\\n\\tTseng ET3000\\n\\tParadise PVGA1\\n\\tWestern Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of\\n\\t\\tthe PVGA1, and use its driver)\\n\\tGenoa GVGA\\n\\tTrident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000\\n\\tATI 18800, 28800\\n\\n\\tAll of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,\\n\\twith the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in\\n\\t256 color mode.\\n\\n\\tThe monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of\\n\\tvideo memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the\\n\\tET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome\\n\\tserver, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.\\n\\n\\tIt appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to\\n\\tnon-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To\\n\\tavoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86\\n\\t1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel\\n\\tclock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are\\n\\tdiscovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how\\n\\tthese programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such\\n\\ta program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with\\n\\tfuture XFree86 releases.\\n\\n\\tIf you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,\\n\\tit is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the\\n\\tOrchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not\\n\\twork with them, because Diamond won\\'t provide programming details.\\n\\tIn fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond\\n\\tproducts, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions\\n\\tof code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).\\n\\tIf you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.\\n\\n\\tSome people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA\\n\\tvideo cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the\\n\\tCPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It\\n\\tcould be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset\\n\\ton the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don\\'t have a lot\\n\\tof access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested\\n\\ttheory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not\\n\\tworking on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86\\n\\tworking fine on them.\\n\\n6. What about accelerated boards?\\n\\n\\tAt this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards\\n\\tlike the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available\\n\\tin commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).\\n\\n\\tAn S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact\\n\\t<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.\\n\\n\\tA beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>\\n\\tor <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.\\n\\n7. Why doesn\\'t XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?\\n\\n\\tThe reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the\\n\\t16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory\\n\\tcontains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-\\n\\tplanes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each\\n\\tof each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-\\n\\tbuffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled\\n\\t16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code\\n\\tcould be modified to support this (or it already may; I\\'m not sure).\\n\\tBut for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer\\n\\timplementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,\\n\\tbut nothing is yet available from the project.\\n\\n8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?\\n\\n\\tObviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run\\n\\tX efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.\\n\\tThe various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending\\n\\ton the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).\\n\\tTo build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will\\n\\tbe required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable \\n\\tlower bound.\\n\\n9. Where can I get source for XFree86?\\n\\n\\tSource patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22\\n\\tfrom MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:\\n\\t\\texport.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)\\n\\t\\tftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)\\n\\t\\tftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)\\n\\t(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)\\n\\n\\tRefer to the README file under the specified directory for information\\n\\ton which files you need to get to build your distribution.\\n\\n10.

Each binary distribution will\\n\\tcontain a README file that describes what files you need to take\\n\\tfrom the archive, and which compile-time option selections were\\n\\tmade when building the distribution.\\n\\nIV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?\\n\\n11. Installation directories\\n\\n\\tThe top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot\\n\\t(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include\\n\\tfiles, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.\\n\\n\\tThis can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified\\n\\tvia symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is\\n\\tnonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed\\n\\talongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.\\n\\n12. Configuration files\\n\\n\\tThe XFree86 server reads a configuration file (\"Xconfig\") on startup.\\n\\tThe search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in\\n\\tthe server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.\\n\\n13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes\\n\\n\\tDavid E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known\\n\\tclock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.\\n\\tThe database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and\\n\\tis in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is\\n\\talso available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on\\n\\texport.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated\\n\\toccasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the\\n\\tsettings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to\\n\\tDavid for inclusion in the database.\\n\\n\\tIf this doesn\\'t help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file \\n\\twith XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.\\n\\tIt may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use\\n\\tthis description to get them right.  When you do, send the information\\n\\tto David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.\\n\\n\\tNOTE: The old \\'clock.exe\\' program is not supported any more, and\\n\\t      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot\\n\\t      clock values for a new board, remove the \\'Clocks\\' line from\\n\\t      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The\\n\\t      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.\\n\\t      You can use these values to put a \\'Clocks\\' line into your\\n\\t      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up\\n\\t      starting the server in the future.\\n\\n14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit\\n\\n\\tIf you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to\\n\\treconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is\\n\\tfully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.\\n\\nV) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?\\n\\n\\tFirst of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).\\n\\n15. SVR4\\n\\tWhy won\\'t my xterm run properly?\\n\\n\\tIf your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define\\n\\tCONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won\\'t run.\\n\\tcsh users should use \\'setenv CONSEM no\\'\\n\\n\\tThe Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping\\n\\tproblems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be\\n\\tinstalled.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.\\n\\n16. SVR3\\n\\n\\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that\\'s what you are running.\\n\\n17. 386BSD\\n\\n\\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.\\n\\n\\tAlso, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey\\n\\t<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the\\n\\tfile XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:\\n\\n\\t    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\\n\\t    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\\n\\t    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\\n\\n18. Linux\\n\\n\\tYou must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc\\n\\tjump libraries installed.\\n\\n\\tMake sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.\\n\\n\\tIf your kernel doesn\\'t have TCP support compiled in, you\\'ll have to\\n\\trun the server as \"X -pn\". The default startup configuration assumes\\n\\tthat TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files\\n\\t/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the\\n\\t-pn argument to X386.\\n\\n\\tMake sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major\\n\\tnumber 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not\\n\\towned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit\\n\\tconsole output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but\\n\\tstartx won\\'t.\\n\\n\\tWhen running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with\\n\\ta tty, for example \"xdm < /dev/console &\".\\n\\n\\tFor more detailed information, please read the file README present\\n\\twith the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.\\n\\n19. Mach\\n\\n\\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.\\n\\nVI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?\\n\\n\\tThis section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is\\n\\tfully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.\\n\\tPlease look at those files for information on building XFree86.\\n\\nVII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?\\n\\n20. BSD compatibility library\\n\\n\\tA lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.\\n\\tThe default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a\\n\\twhich contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),\\n\\tseed(). A better way of providing the \\'b\\' functions is to include\\n\\t<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro\\n\\tdefinitions for these in terms of the SYSV \\'mem\\' functions.  If you are\\n\\tlinking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these\\n\\tfunctions, then you should link with libXbsd.a\\n\\n21. ANSICCOPTIONS\\n\\n\\tThis is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the\\n\\tANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite\\n\\tthe entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you\\'d see\\n\\tsomething like\\n\\t\\tCCOPTIONS=\"-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings\"\\n\\tand to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put\\n\\t\\tCCOPTIONS=\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\"\\n\\tin his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of\\n\\t\\tANSICCOPTIONS=\"-ansi\"\\n\\t\\tCCOPTIONS=\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\"\\n\\tand all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:\\n\\t\\tANSICCOPTIONS=\\n\\tto get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death\\n\\twith -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because\\n\\tCCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must\\n\\tadd \\'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)\\' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.\\n\\nXFree86 Contact Information\\n\\n    Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86\\n    Core Team.

My\\noverall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts manager\\nwhile Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage your\\nfinances.\\n\\nHere are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share:\\n\\n\\tThe ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts:\\n\\tchecking, savings, charge, cash, or brokerage.  You can reconcile\\n\\tyour account statements with the records the program keeps.\\n\\n\\tThe ability to make a budget and track your spending against that\\n\\tbudget.\\n\\n\\tA Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree bill\\n\\tpaying service to pay your bills via your modem.\\n\\t\\n\\tThe ability to print checks on your printer.\\n\\n\\tThe ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments.\\n\\n\\tThe ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts\\n\\tup to date.

This computes compound interest, \\n\\teffects of inflation, loan payments term or interest, yield to\\n\\tmaturity for bonds, savings account yields, days between dates, and\\n\\tloan amortization schedules.  It also has functions to help you \\n\\tdecide whether to refinance your mortgage, whether you can afford\\n\\ta particular home, whether a particular rental property is a good\\n\\tinvestment, whether you should buy lease or rent, and whether\\n\\ta particular investment\\'s cash flow is adequate for your situation.\\n\\tThis module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping\\n\\tyour kids with their tuition.  \\n\\n\\tA net worth module.  This is a place to record all your assets\\n\\tand liabilities.  Your net worth can be computed from this \\n\\tinformation.  Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules\\n\\tare automatically included here.\\n\\n\\tA \"desk\" module.  This includes a small word processor, a card file\\n\\tyou can use to store names, addresses, phone numbers and other vital\\n\\tinformation about friends and associates, a perpetual calander, a\\n\\trudimentary calculator, a to-do list, a reminder list, an appointment\\n\\tlist, and a place to record your phone calls (for those who need to\\n\\ttrack such things).  Your appointments, reminders and to-do list\\n\\tcan be made to display automatically when you start the program.\\n\\nThere are probably some things listed above that Quicken has, but I\\'m almost\\nsure that Quicken doesn\\'t do everything I\\'ve listed.

They are posted with his permission.  The\\nimplications of some details are fascinating.\\n\\n-------\\nDate: Sat, 17 Apr 93 23:05:23 PDT\\nFrom: \"Martin Hellman\" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu>\\nTo: (a long list of recipients)\\nSubject: Clipper Chip\\n\\n\\nMost of you have seen the announcement in Friday\\'s NY Times,\\netc. about NIST (National Institute of Standards & Technology)\\nannouncing the \"Clipper Chip\" crypto device. Several messges\\non the net have asked for more technical details, and some have\\nbeen laboring under understandable misunderstandings given\\nthe lack of details in the news  articles. So here to help out\\nis your friendly NSA link: me. I was somewhat surprised Friday\\nto get a call from the Agency which supplied many of the missing\\ndetails. I was told the info was public, so here it is (the cc of this\\nto Dennis Branstad at NIST is mostly as a double check on my\\nfacts since I assume he is aware of all this; please let me know\\nif I have anything wrong):\\n\\nThe Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in \\nSilicon. Each chip will have two secret, 80-bit keys. One will be the \\nsame for all chips (ie a system-wide key) and the other will be unit \\nspecific. I don\\'t know what NIST and NSA will call them, but I will \\ncall them the system key SK and unit key UK in this message. \\nThe IC will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so \\nthat the system key can be kept secret. (Aside: It is clear that \\nthey also want to keep the algorithm secret and, in my opinion, \\nit may be as much for that as this stated purpose.) The unit key \\nwill be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 \\nand K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow \\nauthorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be \\ndecided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that \\nthey will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they \\nmust be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased. \\nWhen a law enforcement agency gets a court order, they will \\npresent it to these two escrow authorities and receive K1 and \\nK2, thereby allowing access to the unit key UK.\\n\\nIn addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his \\nor her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key \\nplain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be \\nencrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK, \\nand the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part \\nmessage which will then be encrypted under the system key SK \\nproducing\\n\\n     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}\\n\\nWhen a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law \\nenforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information \\nflowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that \\nthey may do this constantly on all links, with or without a \\ncourt order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links \\nover which a message will flow.] This gives the agency access to \\n\\n     E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number\\n\\nin the above message. They then check the serial number \\nof the unit and see if it is on the \"watch list\" for which they \\nhave a court order. If so, they will decrypt E[K; UK] to obtain K, \\nand then decrypt E[M; K] to obtain M.\\n\\nI am still in the process of assessing this scheme, so please do \\nnot take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed \\nscheme. All I am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme \\nmore knowledgably. But I will say that the need for just one court \\norder worries me. I would feel more comfortable (though not \\nnecessarily comfortable!) if two separate court orders were \\nneeded, one per escrow authority. While no explanation is\\nneeded, the following story adds some color: In researching\\nsome ideas that Silvio Micali and I have been kicking around,\\nI spoke with Gerald Gunther, the constitutional law expert\\nhere at Stanford and he related the following story: When\\nEdward Levi became Pres. Ford\\'s attorney general (right\\nafter Watergate), he was visited by an FBI agent asking\\nfor \"the wiretap authorizations.\" When Levy asked for\\nthe details so he could review the cases as required by\\nlaw, the agent told him that his predecessors just turned\\nover 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did not\\ncomply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear: \\nNo single person or authority should have the power to\\nauthorize wiretaps (or worse yet, divulging of personal\\nkeys). Sometimes he or she will be an Edward Levi\\nand sometimes a John Mitchell.\\n\\nMartin Hellman\\n\\n----\\n\\nDate: Sun, 18 Apr 93 11:41:42 PDT\\nFrom: \"Martin Hellman\" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu>\\nTo: smb@research.att.com\\nSubject: Re: Clipper Chip\\n\\nIt is fine to post my previous message to sci.crypt \\nif you also post this message with it in which:\\n\\n1.

I\\'ve typed it in verbatim, for you\\nfolks to chew over. Many of the topics recently\\ndiscussed on sci.space are covered in this.\\n\\nGibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance\\n\\nDr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and\\nTechnology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of\\nthe Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space\\nStation on April 3, three budget options as guidance to\\nthe committee in their deliberations on the redesign of\\nthe space station.\\n\\nA low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7\\nbillion and a high option of $9 billion will be\\nconsidered by the committee. Each option would cover\\nthe total expenditures for space station from fiscal\\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for\\ndevelopment, operations, utilization, Shuttle\\nintegration, facilities, research operations support,\\ntransition cost and also must include adequate program\\nreserves to insure program implementation within the\\navailable funds.\\n\\nOver the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within\\nthe NASA budget for the President\\'s new technology\\ninvestment. As a result, station options above $7\\nbillion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in\\nthe rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space\\nstation option of $9 billion would require $2 billion\\nin offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.\\n\\nGibbons presented the information at an organizational\\nsession of the advisory committee. Generally, the\\nmembers-designate focused upon administrative topics\\nand used the session to get acquainted. They also\\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation\\non the process the Station Redesign Team is following\\nto develop options for the advisory committee to\\nconsider.\\n\\nGibbons also announced that the United States and its\\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and\\nCanadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give\\n\"full consideration\" to use of Russian assets in the\\ncourse of the space station redesign process.\\n\\nTo that end, the Russians will be asked to participate\\nin the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting\\nbasis, so that the redesign team can make use of their\\nexpertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the\\npossible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and\\nsystems. The U.S. and international partners hope to\\nbenefit from the expertise of the Russian participants\\nin assessing Russian systems and technology. The\\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop\\noptions for reducing station costs while preserving key\\nresearch and exploration capabilities. Careful\\nintegration of Russian assets could be a key factor in\\nachieving that goal.\\n\\nGibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is\\ncommitted to the redesigned space station and to making\\nevery effort to preserve the science, the technology\\nand the jobs that the space station program represents.\\nHowever, he also is committed to a space station that\\nis well managed and one that does not consume the\\nnational resources which should be used to invest in\\nthe future of this industry and this nation.\"',\n","  \"\\nNo no no!!!

But if we step back from the name-calling and\\nlook at what people are attempting to say, we see that they are trying\\nto express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the\\nChristian faith. So when people use such words or phrases as \"Word of\\nGod\", \"inerrant\", \"infallibale\", \"The Manufacturer\\'s Handbook\", \"The\\nonly rule of faith and practice in the church today\" to describe the\\nBible, we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at\\nthe mere words they use. Some of the above descriptions are demostratably\\nfalse and others are self-contradictory, but in my experience people are\\ngenerally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even\\nwhen the speaker\\'s words are at variance with their intentions.

There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi, and it\\nscored very highly in my tests, but it was a few points shy of perfect.\\n\\nIncidentally, one of the things everyone should do when they're reading\\nreviews of any product, whether it's monitors or mice, is to read the\\ncriteria and methodology carefully.  Unless you know how the product\\ntesting was done, and on what the scores are based, you can't possibly\\nknow what they really mean.  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently\\nfrom Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the\\nranking.  Likewise, it's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet\\nyour needs unless you know how we did the testing.  After all, some of\\nwhat we do may not apply to you.  Likewise, some of what we do may apply\\nmore closely in one review than in another.  You can't always tell\\nanything from reading the 300 or so words of commentary we write if you\\ndon't also understand the scoring.\",\n","  \"\\nWasn't it Tricky Dick who issued stern warnings to Bush & Clinton\\nnot to 'Lose Russia'?

So\\nthere\\'s a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a\\ngiven context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely\\nand makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums\\nof money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other\\nhand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which\\neventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies\\ncontradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  \"You people call\\nTHIS science?\"   (My opinion, for what it\\'s worth, is that one sees both\\nthese phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)  \\n\\nSome subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor\\nappropriate for a particular investigation.  I don\\'t believe it is \\never possible to banish subjective judgement from science.  \\n\\n\\nMy second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make\\nextremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using\\nmethodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this\\nis true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach\\ntheir discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.\\n\\nWithin mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before\\nthe twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is\\nfamous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later \\nmathematicians did prove them, of course.)  \\n\\nI think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not\\nso much a matter of determining what is true and what\\'s not  as it is a \\nmatter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of \\nincompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to \\nobjectively convince others of the validity of one\\'s results is an\\nessential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step \\nof the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward \\nthat goal then one is not doing science.)\\n\\nWhen a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and\\nseems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also\\nworthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further\\ninvestigation.  \\n\\n\\nAdmittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable\\namount of effort in a \"serious scholarly investigation\" such as I\\nsuggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately \\nspecific question to try and answer.  \\n\\nThe \"science\" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science \\ncurrently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.  \\nI certainly wasn\\'t thinking of some idealized science or the mere use \\nof \"reason and observation.\"\\n\\nOne thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether\\nin many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced\\npractitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.  \\n\\nSince Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with\\nthe study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there \\nis any existing research related to this question.  \\n\\n--\\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \\nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.

The two metal \"thumbs\" are about \\n1-1/2\" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2\" above the base.  The thumbs \\nare covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located more \\ntoward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move in \\neither clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which side \\nof the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from either\\nside.  For instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck\\nor the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it.\\n\\n\\n                 _______________________________\\n                |  __    _______________    __  |\\n                | |  |  |\\t\\t|  |  | |\\n                | |  |  |  \\\\^^/   \\\\^^/  |  |  | |\\n                | |  |  |   ||     ||   |  |  | |\\n                | |  |  |\\t\\t|  |  | |\\n                | |  |  |_______________|  |  | |\\n                | |__|\\t\\t\\t   |__| |\\n                |_______________________________|\\n\\n\\nFor the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (if \\nlaying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or \\nneck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting or\\nstanding, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists are\\nalso impaired (I\\'m typing this over an extended period of time), and I \\ndon\\'t have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down works \\nwell for me.\\n\\nFor my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massager\\nbehind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (or\\nnot so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place.  \\nIf I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few inches \\nwhenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to use \\nthan the commonly used \"home-made\" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together \\n(with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and \\nmove the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better than \\nnothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads are \\nnot in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I don\\'t \\npin it up first.  As far as I\\'m concerned, the easier something like this \\nis to use, the more likely I\\'ll use/do it.  If there are multiple \\nconsiderations/hassles, I\\'m more likely to not bother with it.\\n\\nNot only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motion \\nfor my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on my\\nneck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too hard\\nagainst it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for a\\nfew days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped.  \\nAfter that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point, \\nthe pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged.  \\nI also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is the \\nmost vulnerable point for me.\\n\\nIt also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades,\\nalthough, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes at\\na time) to really work it out.\\n\\nI highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although I\\ncannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since I\\'ve had\\nit such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but also \\nto loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I have\\nbeen ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so this \\nwas very timely  for me.\\n\\nThis is the 1st product I\\'ve ordered from this company and only recently\\nbecame aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have been\\nin business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products and,\\nwhile they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog\\nproducts, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought\\nput into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other ones\\nI\\'ve seen such as \"Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog\" or \"Mature Wisdom\".\\nI\\'m only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (no\\nbig surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs, \\nparticularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefits.\\n\\nI apologize for the length of this, but it\\'s the kind of info _I_ would \\nlike to know before ordering something thru the mail.\\n',\n","  '\\t            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n\\tWell that was pretty uncalled for.

Friday local Tel Aviv\\'s\\npaper, affiliated with Maariv.\\n\\nDate: 19 February 1993\\n\\nJournalist: Guy Ehrlich\\n\\nSubject: Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan\\n(Cherry) units, which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate\\nwithin the occupied territories.\\n\\nExcerpts from the article:\\n\\n\"A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as\\nArabs, things good and bad, some of the falsehoods. But the most\\nimportant problem of those units has been hardly dealt with. It is\\nthat everyone who serves in the Cherry, after a time goes in one\\nway or another insane\".\\n\\nA man who said this, who will here be called Danny (his full name\\nis known to the editors) served in the Cherry. After his discharge\\nfrom the army he works as delivery boy. His pal, who will here be\\ncalled Dudu was also serving in the Cherry, and is now about to\\ndepart for a round-the-world tour. They both look no different\\nfrom average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript\\nservice. But in their souls, one can notice something completely\\ndifferent....It was not easy for them to come out with disclosures\\nabout what happened to them. And they think that to most of their\\nfellows from the Cherry it woundn\\'t be easy either. Yet after they\\nbegan to talk, it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking.\\nThe following article will contain all the horror stories\\nrecounted with an appalling openness.\\n\\n(...) A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team, in\\nwhich some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry. We\\ncalled such soldiers H.I. \\'Hit by the Intifada\\'. Under my command\\nwas a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a common\\nphenomenon in the Cherry. I sent him to a psychiatrist. But why I\\nshould talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? On\\nFridays, when I come home, my parents know I cannot be talked to\\nuntil I go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. The\\nkeys of my father\\'s car must be ready for in advance, so that I\\ncan go there. I they dare talk to me before, or whenever I don\\'t\\nwant them to talk to me, I just grab a chair and smash it\\ninstantly. I know it is my nerve:  Smashing chairs all the time\\nand then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. Only\\nthere I become normal.(...)\\n\\n(...) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother.\\nIt was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next to\\nme and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event which\\nwas still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and how\\nexactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She began\\nto laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry, and she dared laugh\\nstraight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made a\\nmincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov\\ncocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as\\nthey deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, with\\nthe effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. I\\nwas delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets, two at the\\nArab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hit\\nhim straight in his ass. We both felt that we\\'d pulled off\\nsomething.\\n\\nNext I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts\\nin the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that\\nspot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab,\\nblood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: \\'Shut\\nup\\' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed\\nstraight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at\\nsomething convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: \\'All\\nright, wait a moment\\'. I left him in order to take a look at\\nanother wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be\\nsaved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the\\nhelp of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all\\nthis to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight\\ninto my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I felt\\nI was becoming mad. So I stopped eating, seized the plate with he\\nomelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it over\\nher head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didn\\'t know\\nwhat to say.\\n\\n(...) But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls\\nupon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on a\\nfield. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friend\\nshot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the\\nhill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it.\\nWe enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two\\ndeer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks we\\nsaw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to\\nsuch some milk from its already dead mother. We carefully\\ninspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of\\nthe two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We\\nhad hit\\'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too,\\nso as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my\\nrevolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short\\ndistance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the\\nbullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall\\noutside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of\\nblood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of our\\nmadness. Standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were like\\nbeasts of prey. We couldn\\'t explain what had happened to us. We\\nwere almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and we\\nfelt the whole day very badly.\\n\\n(...) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in.\\nThis is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled, may\\nbe for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. You feel\\nGodlike of sorts.\"\\n\\n(...) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment\\nstudying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in any\\nsecurity-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite. \\'Why\\nshouldn\\'t I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well ?\\nWhy shouldn\\'t I earn $3.000 for each chopped head I would deliver\\nwhile being a mercenary in South Africa ?

The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the\\ntransformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the\\nscreen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  My\\nmethod basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the\\nscreen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back of\\nsomething, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so\\nmerely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are\\nlooking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.  Has anyone heard of this\\nmethod before?  It is so simple, I doubt i am the first to think of it.\\n\\nLibertarian, atheist, semi-anarchal Techno-Rat.',\n","  '\\n@===@                                                                     @===@\\n ###  Mark Juric                               A.I.

The trap is the easy way out.\\n\\tFor yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that the\\ndemographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race,\\nand much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You\\'re\\ngoing to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic\\ngroup or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factors\\nleading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually than\\nnot, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.\\n\\tIf, for example, you lived in an area where there were very few\\nBlacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you\\'d see the crime\\nstatistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you then\\nworry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable\\nor whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to\\ndefine \"us\" and \"other\" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerous\\nwhen we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational\\nhumans.\\n\\tIt\\'s interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the\\n*most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don\\'t know the racial\\nmakeup of Phoenix, so I can\\'t speak to your situation. However, I live in\\nSan Francisco, a city that loves to tout its \"ethnic diversity\". Here, we\\nhave Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the \"model minority\") gangs,\\nand even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularly\\ntroublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to their\\npropensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people on\\nthe street and they\\'ll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs and\\ncrime are what they most fear. During the \"disturbance\" in Los Angeles last\\nyear many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! I\\nremember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobs\\nwhere there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleaned\\nfrom TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives\\nthat live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country\\'s first truly\\nmulti-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion that\\nin the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black*\\nriot!\\n\\tIn closing, I\\'d like to say that you raise some interesting points\\nthat really need discussion.

Ahola had\\nonly played 50 games this season (I think it\\'s actually less; the San Jose\\nMercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he\\nhas played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn\\'t been\\nspectacular, and his offense isn\\'t anything to write home about (8 points);\\nit\\'s even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn\\nout to be ...

But next year, which may be\\nWilson\\'s last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.\\n\\n#29\\tDEAN KOLSTAD\\t\\tSeason:\\t2nd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (C-/D+)\\n\\nIt\\'s probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of\\ngames (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he\\'s\\nquickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games,\\nhe did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of\\nthe first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with\\nthe Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward\\nwith his movement and was prone to giveaways.

He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in\\n43 games.  However, his size (5\\' 9\", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after\\nhe began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically,\\non both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach.\\nBut to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance\\non surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.\\n\\n#45\\tCLAUDIO SCREMIN\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (D+/D)\\n\\nHe played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly\\numimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a\\nsmall sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is\\nquickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or\\ndefense in the games he played with the Sharks.

Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try the\\n:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_plot_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\nexample with and without the `remove` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. topic:: Data Considerations\\n\\n  The Cleveland Indians is a major league baseball team based in Cleveland,\\n  Ohio, USA. In December 2020, it was reported that \"After several months of\\n  discussion sparked by the death of George Floyd and a national reckoning over\\n  race and colonialism, the Cleveland Indians have decided to change their\\n  name.\" Team owner Paul Dolan \"did make it clear that the team will not make\\n  its informal nickname -- the Tribe -- its new team name.\" \"It\\'s not going to\\n  be a half-step away from the Indians,\" Dolan said.\"We will not have a Native\\n  American-themed name.\"\\n\\n  https://www.mlb.com/news/cleveland-indians-team-name-change\\n\\n.. topic:: Recommendation\\n\\n  - When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n    should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this\\n    by setting ``remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``. The F-score will be\\n    lower because it is more realistic.\\n  - This text dataset contains data which may be inappropriate for certain NLP\\n    applications. An example is listed in the \"Data Considerations\" section\\n    above. The challenge with using current text datasets in NLP for tasks such\\n    as sentence completion, clustering, and other applications is that text\\n    that is culturally biased and inflammatory will propagate biases. This\\n    should be taken into consideration when using the dataset, reviewing the\\n    output, and the bias should be documented.\\n\\n.. topic:: Examples\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_plot_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_hashing_vs_dict_vectorizer.py`\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_clustering.py`\\n'}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":3}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["dataset = dataset.data"],"metadata":{"id":"tRbuUC7PhnM0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1688514435680,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":167,"user":{"displayName":"바닐라초코푸딩","userId":"12275438551258976942"}}},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["dataset[0]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":90},"id":"VuAp4iSbhybY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1688514435680,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":166,"user":{"displayName":"바닐라초코푸딩","userId":"12275438551258976942"}},"outputId":"97d5e35f-2d63-4778-81b6-026bcdd6edf1"},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'Someone in Canada asked me to send him some public domain DES file\\nencryption code I have.
